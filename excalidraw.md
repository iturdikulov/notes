# Excalidraw

Zettelkasten Type

Excalidraw is a free, open-source (offline and online) virtual whiteboard for
sketching hand-drawn like diagrams (https://excalidraw.com/). While Zettelkasten
traditionally relies on text-based notes, Excalidraw can be a useful addition
for creating [[visual_art|visual representations]] of ideas, concepts, and
relationships between them.

Excalidraw can be used to creating mind maps or concept maps to organize
ideas. Diagramming complex systems or processes. Illustrating metaphors or
analogies. Highlighting key points in a text note with a visual summary.

Excalidraw benefits:

- Improved recall and understanding through visual representation.
- Easier identification of patterns and connections between ideas.
- More engaging and interactive note-taking experience.

Primarily a tool for brainstorming and initial exploration, may not be suitable
for detailed note-taking, for this I use own [[Zettelkasten]] system.

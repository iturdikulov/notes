# Freelancer

> Freelance (sometimes spelled free-lance or free lance), freelancer, or
> freelance worker, are terms commonly used for a person who is self-employed
> and not necessarily committed to a particular employer long-term. Freelance
> workers are sometimes represented by a company or a temporary agency that
> resells freelance labor to clients; others work independently or use
> professional associations or websites to get work.
>
> Fields, professions, and industries where freelancing is predominant include:
> music, writing, acting, [[computer_programming]], web design,
> [[computer_graphics|graphic]] design, translating and illustrating, film and
> video production, and other forms of piece work that some cultural theorists
> consider central to the cognitive-cultural economy.\

# Cheat sheet and reference card

I use mostly cheat-sheets as reference cards. It's give me high-level overview
of the topic and the most important commands.

Primary sources are [[computer]]-related subjects and [[computer_software]].

I also have my own collections of images and PDF files with various
cheat-sheets, quick reference cards and other useful stuff.

A lot of [[computer_software]] include built-in cheatsheets of hotkeys:

- [[Neovim]]:<wbr class="f"> `<leader>fk`, binding to search action/hotkeys in telescope
- [[Slack]]:<wbr class="f"> `C-/`, open list of keyboard shortcuts
- [[cmus]]:<wbr class="f"> `7`, open settings view with shortcuts list
- [[Blender]]:<wbr class="f"> `F3`, open menu search
- [[Sioyek]]:<wbr class="f"> `:`, open commands' palette
- [[Godot]] :<wbr class="f"> `C-S-p`
- [[tmux]]:<wbr class="f"> `C-b`, open list of shortcuts
- [[NNN]]:<wbr class="f"> `?`, open shortcuts list
- [[GIMP]]:<wbr class="f"> `shift+f1`, context help
- [[obsidian]]:<wbr class="f"> `C-S-p`
- youtube.com and many other websites:<wbr class="f"> `?`, open keyboard shortcuts
- chrome web-tools:<wbr class="f"> `?` â†’ `shortctus`, `C-S-p`

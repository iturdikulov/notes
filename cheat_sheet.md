# Cheat sheet and reference card

I use mostly cheat-sheets as reference cards. It's give me high-level overview
of the topic and the most important commands.

Primary sources are [[computer]]-related subjects and [[computer_software]].

I also have my own collections of images and PDF files with various
cheat-sheets, quick reference cards and other useful stuff.

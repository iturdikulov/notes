# Computer Science

In computer science central role plays ==[[algorithm|algorithms]] and [[data_structure|data_structures]]==.

Computer science focuses on methods involved in design, specification, [[computer_programming]], verification, implementation, and [[software_testing]] of human-made [[computer|computing]] systems.

## Core concepts in computer science

Core computer science concepts from Wikipedia[^1].

The theory of computation helping to create **theoretical models (abstract models)** of how to computers work (==computation==) and understanding the **types of problems (general classes of problems)** these computers can solve. So it's about creating abstract computing models and understand which general classes of problems these models can solve.

Cryptography and computer security fields is needed to study (and practice) how to prevent security vulnerabilities and how to communicate securely (secure data transmission).

Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of ==images==.

Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes. Different programming languages can implement computational processes in different ways and can be used to solve different classes of problems.

Database theory concerns the management of repositories of ==data==. For example, you have a bunch of messy data (desktop shortcuts), and you can organize them in some structures (group, sort, etc.) to manage them more effectively.

==Humanâ€“computer interaction== investigates the interfaces through which humans and computers interact. There many UI specialists, which usually haven't developing software skills, but they know how to create effective UI.

Software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind ==developing software==. And usually software engineers solving problems in real world with requirements from customers.

There are many areas (complex systems), which investigate the principles and design in their own area. Main areas are: [[OS|operating systems]], [[computer_network]] and embedded systems.

What describes Computer Architecture?
<br class="f">
[[computer_architecture|Computer architecture]] describes the construction of computer components and computer-operated equipment (Input, Output, CPU, RAM).

Goal of Artificial intelligence?
<br class="f">
[[AI|Artificial intelligence]] and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals. In other words replicate humans and animals processes/behavior.

Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process **image and video data**, while natural language processing aims to understand and process **textual and linguistic data**.

The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.

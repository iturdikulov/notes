# 7z file archiver

File archiver with a high compression ratio. I use it to extract and create
archives in various formats.

> [!NOTE]
> DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix. 7-zip does not
> store the owner/group of the file, instead you can use `tar`.
>
> - to back up a directory: `tar cf - directory | 7z a -si directory.tar.7z`
> - to restore your backup: `7z x -so directory.tar.7z | tar xf -`

Usage:

    7z [Args] [archive.7z] [files / folders to archive]

    Args:
        a       add
        l       list
        x       extract with full paths, preffered method
        e       extract, this command copies all extracted files to one directory
        d       delete
        t       test
        u       update

7z exit codes:

    0       normal (no errors or warnings)
    1       warning (non-fatal errors)
    2       fatal error
    7       bad cli arguments
    8       not enough memory for operation
    255     process was interrupted

## Common usage examples

Add all files in dir1 ti archive.7z with maximum compression

```sh
7z a -t7z -m0=lzma -mx=9 -mfb=64 -md=32m -ms=on archive.7z dir1`
# -t7z        7z archive
# -m0=lzma    lzma method
# -mx=9       level of compression = 9 (ultra)
# -mfb=64     number of fast bytes for lzma = 64
# -md=32m     dictionary size = 32 Mb
# -ms=on      solid archive = on
```

Add (store) all files in dir1 to archive.7z with No Compression
<br class="f">
```sh
7z a -m0=copy archive.7z dir1
```

Add a file or directory to a new or **existing** archive:
<br class="f">
`7z a archive.7z file_or_directory`

Encrypt an existing archive (including filenames):
<br class="f">
`7z a encrypted.7z -ppassword -mhe=on archive.7z`

Extract an archive preserving the original directory structure:
<br class="f">
`7z x archive.7z`

Extract an archive to a specific directory:
<br class="f">
`7z x archive.7z -opath/to/output`

Extract an archive to `stdout`:
<br class="f">
`7z x archive.7z -so`

Archive using a specific archive type:
<br class="f">
`7z a -t7z|bzip2|gzip|lzip|tar|zip archive.7z file_or_directory`

List the contents of an archive:
<br class="f">
`7z l archive.7z`

List available archive types:
<br class="f">
`7z i`

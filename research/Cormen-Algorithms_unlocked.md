# Algorithms unlocked

For anyone who has ever wondered how computers solve problems, an engagingly
written guide for nonexperts to the basics of computer algorithms. Have you ever
wondered how your GPS can find the fastest way to your destination, selecting
one route from seemingly countless possibilities in mere seconds? How your
credit card account number is protected when you make a purchase over the
Internet? The answer is algorithms. And how do these mathematical formulations
translate themselves into your GPS, your laptop, or your smart phone? This book
offers an engagingly written guide to the basics of computer algorithms. In
Algorithms Unlocked, Thomas Cormen—coauthor of the leading college textbook on
the subject—provides a general explanation, with limited mathematics, of how
algorithms enable computers to solve problems. Readers will learn what computer
algorithms are, how to describe them, and how to evaluate them. They will
discover simple ways to search for information in a computer; methods for
rearranging information in a computer into a prescribed order (“sorting”); how
to solve basic problems that can be modeled in a computer with a mathematical
structure called a “graph” (useful for modeling road networks, dependencies
among tasks, and financial relationships); how to solve problems that ask
questions about strings of characters such as DNA structures; the basic
principles behind cryptography; fundamentals of data compression; and even that
there are some problems that no one has figured out how to solve on a computer
in a reasonable amount of time.

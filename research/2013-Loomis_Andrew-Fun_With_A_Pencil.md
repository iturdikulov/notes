Andrew Loomis (1892-1959) is revered amongst artists - including comics
superstar Alex Ross - for his mastery of drawing. His first book, Fun With a
Pencil, published in 1939 is a wonderfully crafted and engaging introduction to

fun. With delightful step-by-step instruction from Professor Blook, Loomis's
charming alter ego on the page.

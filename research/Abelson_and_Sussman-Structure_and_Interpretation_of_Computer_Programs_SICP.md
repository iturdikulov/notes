# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

> Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on
> [[computer_science|computer science]] curricula over the past decade. This
> long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new
> implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book,
> including the [[Interpreter|interpreters]] and [[compiler|compilers]], and the
> authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience
> teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme
> has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different
> approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state,
> concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and
> nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order
> procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical
> programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been
> reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE
> standard.\

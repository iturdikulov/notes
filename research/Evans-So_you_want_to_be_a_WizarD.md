## [[../books/Evans-want_to_be_a_wizard.pdf#page=2|About zhis zine]]

Tips from Julian, looks like mix of team-work and self-productive tips.

- asking questions is good
- reading the source code which knows more than you
- debugging tools are your friend
- design doc helps you to FEEL like a wizard
- building expertise, how to learn something that takes years to master?
- strategies for learning, wow I learned SO MUCH

## [[../books/Evans-want_to_be_a_wizard.pdf#page=6|Asking good questions]]

You are working in team, do I need to ask a question?
&#10;
Ask questions, don't be afraid to ask for help. If no one knows the answer, try
to figure it out anyway.

What if I'm doing something non-standard and have issues? Or I don't really
understand what I'm doing?
&#10;
When you do something non-standard and have issues, you need to go deeper into
details, to understand how things working under the hood. It can be software,
hardware, or whatever.

What's a good question, some rules?
&#10;
- Are easy for the person to answer, choose right one
- With answer you get **required** information
- You provide some context and information when asking, tell what you know,
guess answer, do some research before asking. With this strategy you can even
avoid asking questions that you already know the answer to, or which are too
basic or too complex.
- Choose the right person to ask, maybe less experienced, or more experienced,
depending on the question.
- Find a good time, be respectful of other people's time.
- Ask yes/no questions when possible.

## [[../books/Evans-want_to_be_a_wizard.pdf#page=9|Read the source code]]

What if their no one knows the answer, documentation provide misinformation,
coworkers are busy, etc.? What to do?
&#10;
In that situation your friend is source code, it's newer lie and can provide
required information. Sometimes you need to get your hands dirty and work with
source code: debug, test, print statements, introduce bugs and experiment with
it. Also don't always trust comments (especially yours â˜º).

Strategy to read source code?
&#10;
- Grep for the error message
- Read the whole code if possible (less than few thousand lines, use `cloc`)
- Edit the code ðŸ™Š, debug, test, experiment.

## [[../books/Evans-want_to_be_a_wizard.pdf#page=10|â™¥ Debugging: love your bugs]]

I got a bug, is this end of the world, how to deal with it?
&#10;
Not really, debugging! **Love** your bugs. Debugging is a great way to learn and
write more reliable code (don't break things). Be confident I can fix it, you
already fixed a lot of hard bugs before. The harsh reality of bugs, they reveal
problems with your mental modal, maybe you don't know something or do it not the
right way. Bugs give you opportunity to learn something with immediate feedback.

Can I ignore bugs and think this is normal and this is some mystery?
&#10;
No, bugs happened by logical reason, there are no mysteries, keep this in the
mind.

## [[../books/Evans-want_to_be_a_wizard.pdf#page=12|Learning at work]]

Sometimes you need to learn X to do Y, good strategy to do it?
&#10;
- Read source code
- Ask questions
- Watch talks
- Read docs/blog posts
- Do experiments <!--SR:!2024-08-21,1,230-->

More ways than debugging to work and learn "with bugs"?
&#10;
- Follow up on bugs you couldn't figure out (issues)
- Volunteer to do work that seems hard
- Pay attention to other's code (PR)
- Watch more senior people operate

Is good idea to immediately integrate something which you want to learn (you
haven't enough experience) into work?
&#10;
If you're learning something don't try to immediately integrate it into your
work. Need to discuss and take time to understand the new knowledge.

# 1. Whetting Your Appetite

In this section described when Python can be usable. For example scripting,
simple GUI, etc.

Also described strong points of Python, such as rapid development (simplify
write/compile/test/re-compile cycle), interactivity, extensibility, splitting
into modules, simple integration, automatization, batteries-included, difference
between Python and other languages, such as C, C++, Java, etc.

Python is ==[[Interpreter|interpreted]]== language, no compilation and linking
is necessary (but possible).

# Tao Te Ching

> The Tao Te Ching (RU: Дао дэ цзин; UK: /ˌtaʊ tiː ˈtʃɪŋ/, US: /ˌdaʊ dɛ ˈdʒɪŋ/;
> simplified Chinese: 道德经; traditional Chinese: 道德經; pinyin: Dàodé Jīng
> [tâʊ tɤ̌ tɕíŋ]) is a Chinese classic text and foundational work of Taoism
> written around 400 BC and traditionally credited to the sage Laozi, though the
> text's authorship, date of composition and date of compilation are debated.
> The oldest excavated portion dates back to the late 4th century BC, but modern
> scholarship dates other parts of the text as having been written—or at least
> compiled—later than the earliest portions of the Zhuangzi.
>
> The Tao Te Ching, along with the Zhuangzi, is a fundamental text for both
> philosophical and religious Taoism. It also strongly influenced other schools
> of Chinese philosophy and religion, including Legalism, Confucianism, and
> Chinese Buddhism, which was largely interpreted through the use of Taoist
> words and concepts when it was originally introduced to China. Many artists,
> including poets, painters, calligraphers, and gardeners, have used the Tao Te
> Ching as a source of inspiration. Its influence has spread widely within the
> globe's artistic and academic spheres. It is one of the most translated texts
> in world literature.\

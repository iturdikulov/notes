# Stack (abstract data type)

What is a stack?
<br class="f">
> In [[computer_science]], a **stack** is an [[ADT]] that serves as a [[collection]] of elements, with two main operations:
>
> - **Push**, which adds an element to the collection, and
> - **Pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.\
>   — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))</cite>

Example of stack of layers:

         ____________ precedence
        / LIFO      / | high
    31 /___________// |
    30 /___________// |
    29 /___________/  |
     :   _:_:_:_:_:__ |
     :  / : : : : : / |
     2 /___________// |
     1 /___________// |
     0 /_FILO______/  V low

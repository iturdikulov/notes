# Artificial intelligence (AI)

Sort of [[computer_program]] which mimics human cognition.

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
>
> AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo and Tesla), generative or creative tools ([[ChatGPT]] and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
>
> Goals: The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.

> - Reasoning, problem-solving
> - Knowledge representation
> - Learning
> - Natural language processing
> - Perception
> - Social intelligence
> - General intelligence — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)</cite>

> An extreme goal of AI research is to create computer programs that can learn, solve problems, and think logically. In practice, however, most applications have picked on problems which computers can do well. Searching databases and doing calculations are things computers do better than people. On the other hand, "perceiving its environment" in any real sense is way beyond present-day computing.\

Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models ([[LLM]]s) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences.

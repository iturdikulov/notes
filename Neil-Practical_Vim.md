# Practical Vim: Edit text at the speed of thought

My notes are based on this book + Neovim.

# Cover \1

Coves not great... I also see some artifacts in styling. But content is good.

# Table of Contents \7

Quickly checked it, looks like worth reading.

# Acknowledgments \13

Thanks + contains some story about author's life.

# Foreword to the First Edition \16

# Read Me \17

Practical Vim is for programmers who want to raise their game.

This book focusing on Vim's core features.

## How This Book Is Structured \17

Practical Vim is a recipe book. It's not designed to be read in sequence, you
can read any chapter. Tips can be cross-referred or self-contained.

## A Note on the Examples \18

Many actions in vim can be done in many ways, if you thinking something can be
done faster it can be true, so author just show specific ways, and maybe later
describe how do things with other way.

## Learn to Touch Type, Then Learn Vim \18

Haha... So I probably fit to this (~~only 50wpm right now~~, about 70+wpm, after
I switched from QWERTY to Colemak-DH).

In Vim, everything can be done with keyboard. And for touch typist, that means
Vim does everything faster.

# Read the Forgotten Manual \19

This book more focusing on practices. So need to do examples, rather than read.

## Get to Know Vim's Built-in Documentation \19

How to open vim tutor built-in documentation, interactive tutor?::`:h vimtutor`,
`:Tutor`

Built-in ‚ÑπÔ∏è icons in this book are linked to documentation.

## Notation for Simulating Vim on the Page \20

Describe how keybindings working in Vim. Vim combine chords and keybindings with
modifiers.

Get help about key-notations::`:h key-notation`

Here also good example how to represent keystrokes with ranges of keys,
modifiers, etc. `f{char}`, `m{a-zA-Z}`, etc...

## Downloading the Examples \24

Book contains linked examples, so you can download them and play with them.

## Use Vim's Factory Settings \24

To open vim with default settings run this command ==`vim -u NONE -N`==. -N flag
here reverts vi compatible mode (_nocompatible_). Set nocompatible is completely
ignored in nvim, +1 reason to use it ü§î. But butter just use blank `init.lua`
file, to enable built-in plugins.

## On the Role of Vim Script \25

This book not about `Vim Script`, but it's used widely across the material.

## On Vim Versions \26

How get vim version and health status of current neovim instance, including
plugins?
&#10;<br>
`:checkhealth`, but it can be slow!

# 1. The Vim Way \28

If you know how to craft useful actions using vim, you can reuse them and repeat
effectively.

Big Vim brother is watching you.

## Tip 1. Meet the Dot Command \28

Dot command is sort of "micro" macro.

Dot command help::`:h .`.
<!--SR:!2023-06-07,3,258-->

Test snippet:
```text
Line one
Line two
Line three
Line four
```

`x`::Delete character under cursor.

`u`::Undo.

`dd`::Delete current line.
<!--SR:!2023-06-07,3,266-->

`.`::repeat last command, for example deletion

`>{motion}`::Increase indentation depending on motion.

`>G`
&#10;<br>
Increase indentation from the current line until the end of the file (in
Markdown until section?). You can repeat this command, go down 1 line and press
`.` key.

`>}`::Increase indentation for paragraph forward.

Do vim record keystrokes if we enter insert mode and type something?
&#10;<br>
Yes, we can even repeat or paste these keystrokes - `.`, `".p`
<!--SR:!2023-06-08,3,258-->

## Tip 2. Don't Repeat Yourself \31

DRY - ==Don't Repeat Yourself==.

Difference between `i` and `a`?
&#10;<br>
`i` insert before cursor, `a` insert after cursor.

`$`::Move to the end of the line.

`a;`::Insert semicolon after cursor.

Test snippet:
```javascript
var foo = 1
var bar = "a"
var foobar = foo + bar
```

How run normal mode commands across a range?::use `:normal` command.
<!--SR:!2023-06-05,1,238-->

`C`::Change to the end of the line and set insert mode.

`s`::Delete character under cursor and set insert mode.

`S`::Delete current line and set insert mode.

`I`::Insert at the beginning of the line.

`A`::Insert at the end of the line.

`o`::Insert new line below current line and set insert mode.

`O`::Insert new line above current line and set insert mode.

## Tip 3. Take One Step Back, Then Three Forward \33

How to add space padding for each `+` sign here (dot method)?

```javascript
var foo = "method("+argument1+","+argument2+")";
```
&#10;<br>
1. search first `+` sign - `f+` or `/+<CR>`
2. insert space before and after - `s + <Esc>`
3. search all next `+` signs and repeat - `;.` or `n.`

`f{char}`::Find {char} forward in current line.

`;`::Repeat last `f`, `F`, `t`,

`T` command.

## Tip 4. Act, Repeat, Reverse \35

`@:`::Repeat last ex command.

`&`::Repeat last substitution (on the current line).

`u`::Undo.

`,`::Repeat last `f`, `F`, `t`, `T` command in reverse.

Make a change, repeat, undo::{edit}, `.`, `u`

Scan line for next character, repeat, undo::`f{char}/t{char}`, `;`, `,`

Scan line for previous character, repeat, undo::`F{char}/T{char}`, `;`, `,`

Scan document for next match, repeat, undo::`/pattern<CR>`, `n`, `N`

Scan document for previous match, repeat, undo::`?pattern<CR>`, `n`, `N`

Perform substitution, undoat, undo::`:s/old/new/`, `&`, `u`
<!--SR:!2023-06-06,1,238-->

Execute a sequence of changes (record & execute macro), repeat,
undo::`qx{changes}q`, `@x`, `u`

Difference between `:s` and `:%s`
&#10;<br>
`%` is the range over which the `:s` command (short for `:substitute`) will be
run. `%` itself is short for the range `:1,$`, which means Line 1 to the last
line in the buffer. The Vim help has a couple topics (user manual - `:help
10.3`, reference manual - `:help cmdline-ranges`) describing the forms that
ranges can take.
`:s` also support ranges, like `:1,3s/old/new/`.

## Tip 5. Find and Replace by Hand \36

Goal of this article search and replace interactive.

```
...We're waiting for copy before the site can go live...
...If you are content with this, let's go ahead with it...
...We'll launch as soon as we have the copy...
```

`*`::Search for word under cursor.

`#`::Search for word under cursor in reverse.

`ciw`::Change inner word.

`cw`::Change word from cursor to the end of the word.

# Fail2Ban

Fail2ban is an intrusion prevention software framework. Written in the Python
programming language, it is designed to prevent [[brute-force_attack]]. It is
able to run on POSIX systems that have an interface to a packet-control system
or firewall installed locally, such as iptables or TCP Wrapper.

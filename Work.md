# Work (human activity)

> Work or labor (or labour in Commonwealth English) is the intentional
> activity people perform to support the needs and wants of themselves,
> others, or a wider community. In the context of economics, work can be
> viewed as the human activity that contributes (along with other factors
> of production) towards the goods and services within an economy.
>
> Work is fundamental to all societies, but can vary widely within and
> between them, from gathering natural resources by hand to **operating
> complex technologies** that substitute for physical or even mental effort
> by many human beings. All but the simplest tasks also require specific
> **skills**, **equipment** or **tools**, and other resources (such as
> material for manufacturing goods). Cultures and individuals across
> history have expressed a wide range of attitudes towards work. Outside of
> any specific process or industry, humanity has developed a variety of
> institutions for situating work in society. As humans are diurnal, they
> work mainly during the day.\

## Organize

I organize my work using, [[Getting_things_done_GTD|GTD]] mainly using
Inbox, Tasks (TODO and NEXT), Daily and Weekly notes with [[Taskwarrior]].

To follow external timelines I sometimes use [[Calendar|calendar]] events,
but it's secondary task planner.

To connect with colleagues I use [[Instant_messaging|IM]] and
[[Email|email]] clients.

In my work significantly help my [[Development_Environment]], [[backup]]
plan and daily [[Maintenance]], with attention to [[Computer_security]]
practices.

Currently, I'm working now as a full-stack software engineer in a small company
(remote, full-stack position, but moving into [[backend]]
position).

I also use various [[My_awesome_software_list|software]] and
[[My_awesome_web_services_list|services]] in my work.

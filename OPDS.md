# Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS)

> The Open Publication Distribution System (OPDS) catalog format is a
> syndication format for electronic publications based on Atom and HTTP. OPDS
> catalogs enable the aggregation, distribution, discovery, and acquisition of
> electronic publications. OPDS catalogs use existing or emergent open standards
> and conventions, with a priority on simplicity.
>
> The Open Publication Distribution System specification is prepared by an
> informal grouping of partners, combining Internet Archive, O'Reilly Media,
> Feedbooks, OLPC, and others.\

I have [[OPDS]] OPDS server, to host my fiction books.

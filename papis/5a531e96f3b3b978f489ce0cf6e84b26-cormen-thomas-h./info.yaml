abstract: For anyone who has ever wondered how computers solve problems, an engagingly
  written guide for nonexperts to the basics of computer algorithms. Have you ever
  wondered how your GPS can find the fastest way to your destination, selecting one
  route from seemingly countless possibilities in mere seconds? How your credit card
  account number is protected when you make a purchase over the Internet? The answer
  is algorithms. And how do these mathematical formulations translate themselves into
  your GPS, your laptop, or your smart phone? This book offers an engagingly written
  guide to the basics of computer algorithms. In Algorithms Unlocked, Thomas Cormen—coauthor
  of the leading college textbook on the subject—provides a general explanation, with
  limited mathematics, of how algorithms enable computers to solve problems. Readers
  will learn what computer algorithms are, how to describe them, and how to evaluate
  them. They will discover simple ways to search for information in a computer; methods
  for rearranging information in a computer into a prescribed order (“sorting”); how
  to solve basic problems that can be modeled in a computer with a mathematical structure
  called a “graph” (useful for modeling road networks, dependencies among tasks, and
  financial relationships); how to solve problems that ask questions about strings
  of characters such as DNA structures; the basic principles behind cryptography;
  fundamentals of data compression; and even that there are some problems that no
  one has figured out how to solve on a computer in a reasonable amount of time.

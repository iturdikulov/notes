# Trie

> In computer science, a trie (/ˈtriː/, /ˈtraɪ/), also called digital tree or
> prefix tree, is a type of k-ary search tree, a tree data structure used for
> locating specific keys from within a set. These keys are most often strings,
> with links between nodes defined not by the entire key, but by individual
> characters. In order to access a key (to recover its value, change it, or
> remove it), the trie is traversed depth-first, following the links between
> nodes, which represent each character in the key.
>
> Unlike a binary search tree, nodes in the trie do not store their associated
> key. Instead, a node's position in the trie defines the key with which it is
> associated. This distributes the value of each key across the data structure,
> and means that not every node necessarily has an associated value.\

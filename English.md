# English language

English is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European
[[language_family|language family]].

> English is a language that started in Anglo-Saxon England. It is originally
> from Anglo-Frisian and Old Saxon dialects. English is now used as a global
> language. There are about 375 million native speakers (people who use it as
> their first language) in the world.
>
> Frisian is the language closest to English. The vocabulary of English was
> influenced by other Germanic languages in the early Middle Ages and later by
> Romance languages, especially French.
>
> English has changed and developed over time, like all other languages. The
> most obvious changes are the many words taken from Latin and Old French, which
> then came to Old English and then Modern English, which is used today.
>
> English grammar has also become very different from other Germanic languages,
> but it stayed different from Romance languages. Because nearly 60% of the
> vocabulary comes from Latin, English is sometimes called the Germanic language
> that is the most Latin, and it is often mistaken for being a Romance language.

## Collactions (словосочетания)

One method to learn English is learning collocations. They very useful to learn
natural language. Collocations are words that are used together in a sentence.
There are some types of collocations: Fixed, Strong, and Weak.

## English grammar

Examples of correct English language parts (paragraphs, sentences, words and
other parts), main soruce is [English grammar -
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_grammar) webpage.

Using dash, en-dash, capitalization:

    This article describes a generalized, present-day Standard English – forms
    of speech and writing used in public discourse, including broadcasting,
    education, entertainment, government, and news, over a range of registers,
    from formal to informal. Divergences from the grammar described here occur
    in some historical, social, cultural, and regional varieties of English,
    although these are minor compared to the differences in pronunciation and
    vocabulary.

Using text in quotes,

    Modern English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system of
    Indo-European in favor of analytic constructions. The personal pronouns
    retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant
    of the more extensive Germanic case system of Old English). For other
    pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is
    indicated only by word order, by prepositions, and by the "Saxon genitive or
    English possessive" (-'s).

Using semicolon in sentence:

    The rest are closed classes; for example, it is rare for a new pronoun to
    enter the language.

Using cursive:

    For example, _my very good friend Peter_ is a phrase that can be used in a
    sentence as if it were a noun, and is therefore called a noun phrase.

Using parentheses:

    Many common suffixes form nouns from other nouns or from other types of
    words, such as -age (shrinkage), -hood (sisterhood), and so on, though many
    nouns are base forms containing no such suffix (cat, grass, France).

Using word forms:

    Countable nouns generally have singular and plural forms. In most cases the
    plural is formed from the singular by adding _\-\[e\]s_ (as in _dogs_,
    _bushes_), although there are also irregular forms (_woman/women_,
    _foot/feet_), including cases where the two forms are identical (_sheep_,
    _series_).

Using unordered lists:

    Particular forms of noun phrases include:

    - phrases formed by the determiner the with an adjective, as in the
      homeless, the English (these are plural phrases referring to homeless
      people or English people in general);
    - phrases with a pronoun rather than a noun as the head (see below);
    - phrases consisting just of a possessive;
    - infinitive and gerund phrases, in certain positions;
    - certain clauses, such as that clauses and relative clauses like what he
      said, in certain positions.

    Many nouns that mention people's roles and jobs can refer to either a
    masculine or a feminine subject, for instance "cousin", "teenager",
    "teacher", "doctor", "student", "friend", and "colleague".

        - Jane is my friend. She is a dentist.
        - Paul is my cousin. He is a dentist.

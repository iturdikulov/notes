# Analysis of algorithms

The process of finding the computational ==[[computational_complexity]]== of
algorithms is called analysis of algorithms [^1].

Which method can be used to compare, predict performance, and understand
various trade-offs between two algorithms?
<br class="f">
Analysis of algorithms helps compare algorithms, predict performance, and
understand trade-offs between resources (time/memory). It is crucial for
optimizing [[computation|computational]] efficiency.

The search process of X characterizes the effectiveness of the algorithm. What X
is?
<br class="f">
In [[computer_science]] this is the process of finding the
[[computational_complexity]] (number of steps, which depends on input size) of
[[algorithm]]s. For example amount of time to execeute an algorithm, required
storage or memory.

Efficiency of algorithms is measured by?
<br class="f">
Efficiency of algorithms is measured by its function's values: value is small or
grow slowly compared to a growth in the size on input.

Different inputs of the same size may cause the algorithm to have different
behavior, so best, worst and average case descriptions might all be of
practical interest.

When not otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an
algorithm is usually an upper bound, determined from the worst case inputs to
the algorithm.

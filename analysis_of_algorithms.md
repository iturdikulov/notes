# Analysis of algorithms

> In [[computer_science|computer science]], the analysis of [[algorithm]]s is
> the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms—the amount
> of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them.
> Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the size of an
> algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its
> [[time_complexity|time complexity]]) or the number of storage locations it
> uses (its space complexity). An algorithm is said to be efficient when this
> function's values are small, or grow slowly compared to a growth in the size
> of the input. Different inputs of the same size may cause the algorithm to
> have different behavior, so best, worst and average case descriptions might
> all be of practical interest. When not otherwise specified, the function
> describing the performance of an algorithm is usually an upper bound,
> determined from the worst case inputs to the algorithm.\

# Analysis of algorithms

> In [[Computer_science]], the analysis of [[algorithm]]s is the
> process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms—the amount of
> time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them.
> Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the size of an
> algorithm's input to the number of steps it takes (its [[Time_complexity]]) or
> the number of storage locations it uses (its space complexity). An algorithm
> is said to be efficient when this function's values are small, or grow slowly
> compared to a growth in the size of the input. Different inputs of the same
> size may cause the algorithm to have different behavior, so best, worst and
> average case descriptions might all be of practical interest. When not
> otherwise specified, the function describing the performance of an algorithm
> is usually an upper bound, determined from the worst case inputs to the
> algorithm.\

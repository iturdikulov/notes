# GNU Core Utilities

Here I store basic coreutils and similar tools that I use on a daily basis.
A lot of these commands also usually exist in this
[[Unix_commands|Unix commands]] list.

Source code of coreutils can be found at gnu.org website:
[coreutils.git](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git)

# Stock photography

> Supply of photographs which are often licensed for specific uses. The stock
> industry, which began to gain hold in the 1920s, has established models
> including traditional macrostock [[photography]], midstock photography, and
> microstock photography. Professional stock photographers traditionally place
> their images with one or more stock agencies on a contractual basis, while
> stock agencies may accept the high-quality photos of amateur photographers
> through online submission.\

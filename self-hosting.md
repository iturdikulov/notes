# Self-hosting (web services)

> The practice of running and maintaining a website or service using a private

For me self-hosting is way to easily share data between devices, and to have
full control over my data with minimal latency, and maximal speed.

TODO: review this services and maybe add some of them to my self-hosting:
[envs.net | environments](https://envs.net/)

# GNU Privacy Guard (GPG or GnuPG)

> Free-software replacement for Symantec's PGP cryptographic software suite. The
> software is compliant with RFC 4880, the IETF standards-track specification of
> OpenPGP. Modern versions of PGP are interoperable with GnuPG and other
> OpenPGP-compliant systems.
>
> GnuPG is part of the GNU Project and received major funding from the German
> government in 1999.
>
> GnuPG is a hybrid-encryption software program because it uses a combination of
> conventional symmetric-key cryptography for speed, and
> [[public-key cryptography|public-key cryptography]]
> for ease of secure key exchange, typically by using the recipient's public key
> to encrypt a session key which is used only once. This mode of operation is
> part of the OpenPGP standard and has been part of PGP from its first version.
>
> The GnuPG 1.x series uses an integrated cryptographic library, while the GnuPG
> 1.x series replaces this with Libgcrypt.

# Code

> In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules to
> convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into
> another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for communication through a
> communication channel or storage in a storage medium. An early example is an
> invention of language, which enabled a person, through speech, to communicate
> what they thought, saw, heard, or felt to others. But speech limits the range
> of communication to the distance a voice can carry and limits the audience to
> those present when the speech is uttered. The invention of writing, which
> converted spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of
> communication across space and time.\
>
> In [[Information_theory|information theory]]
> and [[Computer_science|computer science]], a code is usually considered as an
> algorithm that uniquely represents symbols from some source alphabet, by
> encoded strings, which may be in some other target alphabet. An extension of
> the code for representing sequences of symbols over the source alphabet is
> obtained by concatenating the encoded strings.

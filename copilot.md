# Copilot

> GitHub Copilot (not to be confused with, "Copilot X", the name of GitHub's
> "vision" for next-gen Copilot features) is a cloud-based artificial
> intelligence tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI to assist users of Visual
> Studio Code, Visual Studio, [[Neovim]], and JetBrains integrated development
> environments (IDEs like [[Pycharm]]) by autocompleting code. Currently
> available by subscription to individual developers and to businesses, the tool
> was first announced by GitHub on 29 June 2021, and works best for users coding
> in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, and Go.\

Currently, I use it mostly to automate repetitive tasks.

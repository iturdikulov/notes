# How do I sync my data (and use it)

Mainly I have this data:

- Working projects, out of sync. It's very critical to avoid data loss. I use [[Borg]] for daily backup.
- Wiki library, synced by [[Resilio_Sync]], two-way (data storage ↔ phone and tablet). To avoid data loss, I am using [[Git]] and backup system using [[Borg]]. Additionally, my sync server usually online, to avoid sync conflicts. Ignored directories: `.obsidian`, `.git`. I also place here additional data:
  - Current reading fiction books 
  - Current reading technical books, research papers and other documents with notes
  - My art
  - Saved articles 
- Music, synced two-way. I use it mostly to listen music offline.
- Photos from tablet and phone, synced one way (phone and tablet → data storage), to avoid data loss. I import them into library using [[darktable]] and then delete from phone and tablet manually after processing.
- Videos are manged by samba server.

# Rendering (computer graphics)

> Rendering or image synthesis is the process of generating a photorealistic or
> non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model by means of a
> [[computer_program]]. The resulting image is referred to as the render.
> Multiple models can be defined in a scene file containing objects in a
> strictly defined language or data structure. The scene file contains geometry,
> viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information describing the virtual
> scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering
> program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image
> file. The term "rendering" is analogous to the concept of an artist's
> impression of a scene. The term "rendering" is also used to describe the
> process of calculating effects in a video editing program to produce the final
> video output.
>
> Rendering is one of the major sub-topics of [[3D_computer_graphics]], and in
> practice it is always connected to the others. It is the last major step in
> the graphics pipeline, giving models and animation their final appearance.
> With the increasing sophistication of computer graphics since the 1970s, it
> has become a more distinct subject.\

# API

> An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more
> [[computer_program]] to communicate with each other. It is a type of software
> interface, offering a service to other pieces of [[computer_software]]. A
> document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or
> interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this
> standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term API may refer either
> to the specification or to the implementation
>
> In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an
> application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to
> each other. It is not intended to be used directly by a person (the end user)
> other than a computer programmer who is incorporating it into the software. An
> API is often made up of different parts which act as tools or services that
> are available to the programmer. A program or a programmer that uses one of
> these parts is said to call that portion of the API. The calls that make up
> the API are also known as subroutines, methods, requests, or endpoints. An API
> specification defines these calls, meaning that it explains how to use or
> implement them.
>
> One purpose of APIs is to hide the internal details of how a system works,
> exposing only those parts that a programmer will find useful, and keeping them
> consistent even if the internal details change later. An API may be
> custom-built for a particular pair of systems, or it may be a shared standard
> allowing interoperability among many systems.\

API is way to communicate between two or more computer programs.

API can be public or private, documented or undocumented, standardized or not,
versioned or not, etc.

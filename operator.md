# Operator

How you can describe operator purpose in computing?
&#10;
Operator is generally like functions (with different syntax) with specific
purpose and used very often. Usually operators defined by programming language
itself.

> In [[computer_programming|computer programming]], operators are **constructs**
> defined within programming languages which behave generally like
> ==functions==, but which differ syntactically or semantically.
>
> Common simple examples include arithmetic (e.g. addition with `+`), comparison
> (e.g. "greater than" with `>`), and logical operations (e.g. AND, also written
> `&&` in some languages). More involved examples include assignment (usually
> `=` or `:=`), field access in a record or object (usually `.`), and the scope
> resolution operator (often `::` or `.`). Languages usually define a set of
> built-in operators, and in some cases allow users to add new meanings to
> existing operators or even define completely new operators.\

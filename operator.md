# Operator

How you can describe operator purpose in computing?
<br class="f">
Operator is generally like functions (with different syntax) with specific purpose and used very often. Usually operators defined by programming language itself.

> In [[computer_programming]], operators are **constructs** defined within programming languages which behave generally like ==functions==, but which differ syntactically or semantically.
>
> Common simple examples include arithmetic (e.g. addition with `+`), comparison (e.g. "greater than" with `>`), and logical operations (e.g. AND, also written `&&` in some languages). More involved examples include assignment (usually `=` or `:=`), field access in a record or object (usually `.`), and the scope resolution operator (often `::` or `.`). Languages usually define a set of built-in operators, and in some cases allow users to add new meanings to existing operators or even define completely new operators.\

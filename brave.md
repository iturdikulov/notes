# Brave (web browser)

Free open source browser.

Key features for me:

- Rich ad blocking (Shield), and it's available for all [[computing_platform]]
  which I use.
- Support for extensions.
- [[Video_acceleration_API]] support on [[GNU_Linux]]
- [[browser_devtools]] support.
- Built-in browser sync, and it's available for all platforms which I use.

# Computer

> A computer is a machine that can be ==programmed== to carry out sequences of
> arithmetic or logical operations ([[computation]]) automatically. Modern
> digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as
> [[computer_program|programs]]. These programs enable computers to perform a
> wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that
> includes the hardware, [[OS|operating system]] (main software), and peripheral
> equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a
> group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
> [[computer_network]] or computer cluster.\

## Central processing unit (CPU)

Some electronic circuit, which executes instructions of a [[computer_program]],
such as [[arithmetic]] logic, controlling, and [[input_output]] operations.

### CPU-bound

A task, job or process is said to be CPU-bound (or compute-bound) when the time
it takes for it to complete is determined principally by the speed of the
==CPU==.

Common examples of CPU bound operations:

- Audio or image processing. Convert video.
- Computer vision: an image is composed of millions of pixels, each pixel has 3
  values / colors, processing that normally requires computing something on
  those pixels, all at the same time. Resize image.
- Machine Learning: it normally requires lots of "matrix" and "vector"
  multiplications. Think of a huge spreadsheet with numbers and multiplying all
  of them together at the same time.
- Deep Learning: this is a sub-field of Machine Learning, so, the same applies.
  It's just that there is not a single spreadsheet of numbers to multiply, but a
  huge set of them, and in many cases, you use a special processor to build and
  / or use those models.

# Computer

> A computer is a machine that can be ==programmed== to carry out sequences of
> arithmetic or logical operations ([[computation]]) automatically. Modern
> digital electronic computers can perform generic sets of operations known as
> [[computer_program|programs]]. These programs enable computers to perform a
> wide range of tasks. A computer system is a nominally complete computer that
> includes the hardware, [[OS|operating system]] (main software), and peripheral
> equipment needed and used for full operation. This term may also refer to a
> group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a
> [[computer_network]] or computer cluster.\

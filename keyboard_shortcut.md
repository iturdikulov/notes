# Keyboard shortcut

> In [[computing]], a keyboard shortcut also known as hotkey is a
> series of one or several keys to quickly invoke a software program or perform
> a preprogrammed action.
>
> This action may be part of the standard functionality
> of the operating system or application program, or it may have been written by
> the user in a scripting language.
>
> Some integrated keyboards also include pointing devices; the definition of
> exactly what counts as a "key" sometimes differs.\

[[touch_typing|Touch typing]] and keyboard shortcuts are main driver of
mouseless workflow. In this note I describe the most used shortcuts in my
workflow, each section except "Universal" is linked to a more detailed note.

In this file I place **basic** keybindings list for each my most used program,
with link to detailed keybindings in separate note.

## QMK

I have a keyboard with [[QMK]] firmware, which allows me to create custom
keyboard layers, macros and other features.

I use [[Colemak_Mod-DH]] layout (not hardware, I use system layout) and my own
navigation and symbols layers.

My layers and modifiers:

Hold `SYM` to activate the symbols layer.
Hold `NAV` to activate the navigation layer

The home row modifiers are `oneshot` so that it's possible to modify the keys on
the base layer, where there are no dedicated modifiers.

Sometimes you need to use qwerty layout (games for example), I created special
layer in QMK for that, which activate qwerty layout over the Colemak-DH layout
when I press special `QWE` default layer switch button (toggle logic).

## Universal

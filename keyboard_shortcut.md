# Keyboard shortcut

> In [[computing]], a keyboard shortcut also known as hotkey is a series of one or several keys to quickly invoke a software program or perform a pre-programmed action.
> 
> This action maybe part of the standard functionality of the operating system or application program, or it may have been written by the user in a scripting language.
> 
> Some integrated keyboards also include pointing devices; the definition of exactly what counts as a "key" sometimes differs.\
> â€”â€‰<cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_shortcut)</cite>

[[touch_typing|Touch typing]] and [[computer_keyboard]] shortcuts are main driver of mouseless workflow. In this note I describe the most used shortcuts in my workflow, each section except "Universal" is linked to a more detailed note.

Sometimes you need to create and use non-standard shortcuts, and this [Keyboard Heatmap](https://www.patrick-wied.at/projects/heatmap-keyboard/) tool can find most used keys, you can type comfort keys for you, analyze heatmap and decide which keys you want to use.

In this file I place **basic** keybindings list for each my most used program, with link to detailed keybindings in separate note.

## Universal

Notepad based shortcuts, work mostly in all "classic" GUI program.

## Other

I can setup `RightAlt-` to ISO level3 Shift (type characters like Â¡ÂºÂªÂ¢Ã¡ÃŸ while holding `RightAlt-`, label `2`) and `Shift-RightAlt-` to ==compose== key (one key press + sequence) in KDE, system settings â†’ configure switching â†’ alternate symbols. <!--SR:!2025-08-03,3,250-->

My current Desktop Environment is KDE and I use a lot customized [[KDE_common_shortcuts]].

Since my most used program is Neovim, I have a lot of shortcuts for it. To quit I use `ZZ`, `:x`, `:q` and `:qa` ðŸ˜¼. I store basic keybindings in my [[vim_base_keybindings|Base keybindings]] note and more advanced in [[Neovim]].

[[GNU_Readline]] used in many programs like Bash, Python, etc. So I need to know some basic keybindings to work with it.

[[Obsidian#Hotkeys|Obsidian]] is my [[Telekasten|Zettelkasten system]] companion, main task is to render markdown, process [[spaced_repetition]] notes and work with [[excalidraw]] diagrams.

Browser, currently, I use [[Firefox]] with [[Vimium]] extension.

I use [[Zathura]] to read PDFs. It's fast and support many formats.

[[Slack]] is my team communication tool.

[[Blender]] is my favorite 3D modeling software.

I use [[Krita]] as my primary drawing tool.

[[Inkscape]] is a vector graphics editor. I use it rarely, but it's very powerful, and I'm planning to learn it more.

I use [[MPV]] as my main multimedia player.

[[cmus]] is my favorite audio-player, near to zero setup, and keyboard driven.

I use [[Zsh]] as my main interactive command interpreter. Some keybindings from GNU readline are available in Z shell, but I usually use Vi-mode in Zsh, and it has its own keybindings. To enter Vi-mode in Zsh type `Esc`, to back to insert mode type `i`.

I use [[fzf]] as main UI provider for list of anything, for mine shell scripts and commands.

For reverse search in history with ==`C-r`== hotkey and ==`Up`== key, I use [atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin).

Remove item from atuin:

- Select the entry you want to delete
- Press `C-o` to open the inspector
- Press `C-d` to delete the entry NOTE: there is no confirmation dialog after pressing `C-d`.

Lazygit as [[version_control]] tool, to list shortcuts press `?` in TUI.

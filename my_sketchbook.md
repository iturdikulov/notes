# My digital art sketchbook

My first steps in [[art]] creation.

This is place where I store my drawings. Some are digital some are scanned from
paper. I'll place here more [[art]] related stuff. I use [[PureRef]] to store my
reference images all them aviable in [pur](./img/my_sketchbook.pur) file.

Remember to **have fun** and experiment with different styles and techniques as
you complete the challenge!

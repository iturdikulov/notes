# Emotion

> Emotions are what people feel. They are very ancient, and can be seen in all
> mammals.
>
> Emotions are caused by a complex mixture of hormones and the unconscious mind.
> Only with great difficulty can we control our emotions by conscious effort.
> They cause mammals to change behaviour according to changes in their
> situation. In our case they sometimes run against our attempt to live our
> lives in a logical way.
>
> A scientific definition is not simple; over 90 definitions have been offered
> by experts. A definition of emotion needs to include three things:
>
> conscious experience (feelings) expressions which can be seen by others
> actions of the body ('physiological arousal') Here is one definition:
>
> "Emotion is a complex psychological phenomenon which occurs as animals or
> people live their lives. Emotions involve [[psychology|physiological]]
> arousal, appraisal of the situation, expressive behaviours, and conscious
> experience. Emotion is associated with feeling, mood, temperament,
> personality, disposition, and motivation". In physical terms, emotions involve
> body systems which have operated for hundreds of millions of years. These are
> the hormone system, the autonomic nervous system and the 'lower' brain centers
> (hindbrain and midbrain).

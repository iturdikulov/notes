# Event (computing)

> Action or occurrence recognized by [[computer_program|software]], often
> originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled
> by the software. Computer events can be generated or triggered by the
> [[operating_system|system]], by the user, or in other ways. Typically, events
> are handled synchronously with the program flow; that is, the software may
> have one or more dedicated places where events are handled, frequently an
> event loop.\

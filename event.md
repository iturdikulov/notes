# Event (computing)

> Action or occurrence recognized by [[computer_program|software]], often originating asynchronously from the external environment, that may be handled by the software. Computer events can be generated or triggered by the [[OS|system]], by the user, or in other ways. Typically, events are handled synchronously with the program flow; that is, the software may have one or more dedicated places where events are handled, frequently an event loop.\

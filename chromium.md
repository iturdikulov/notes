# Chromium browser

My main browser.

Reasons why I use it:

- DevTools/most + most popular browser. So I usually use it in my work.
- I use chromium (ungoogled chromium) instead of Google Chrome because it's open
  source.
- Habit.

## Must have extensions

- Browserpass (`browserpass-chromium` package in Arch Linux).
- [NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store)
  Allows adding extensions from Chrome web store on ungoogled-chromium. Also
  adds semi-automatic extension updating.
- [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm),
  to make web faster and safer and look better.
- [vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb),
  I know about different extensions and browsers. But for me vimium good enough.
- [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors), I use it with
  [[Papis]] integration (zotero-papis).
- [SponsorBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone),
  to skip sponsored segments of YouTube videos.
- [FrankerFaceZ](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frankerfacez/fadndhdgpmmaapbmfcknlfgcflmmmieb),
  to make Twitch better.
- [Picture In Picture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg),
  to watch videos in a floating window (always on top).

TODO: add flags and settings, and
[config](file:///home/inom/.config/chromium-flags.conf).

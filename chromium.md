# Chromium browser

> Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web. This site contains design documents, architecture overviews, testing information, and more to help you learn to build and work with the Chromium source code.

My secondary browser.

Reasons why I use it:

- DevTools/most + most popular browser. So I usually use it in my work.

## Must have extensions

- Browserpass (`browserpass-chromium` package in Arch Linux).
- [NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/chromium-web-store) Allows adding extensions from Chrome web store on ungoogled-chromium. Also adds semi-automatic extension updating.
- [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm), to make web faster and safer and look better.
- [vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb), I know about different extensions and browsers. But for me vimium good enough.
- [SponsorBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sponsorblock-for-youtube/mnjggcdmjocbbbhaepdhchncahnbgone), to skip sponsored segments of YouTube videos.
- [Picture In Picture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/picture-in-picture-extens/hkgfoiooedgoejojocmhlaklaeopbecg), to watch videos in a floating window (always on top).

- [ ] add flags and settings, and [config](file:///home/inom/.config/chromium-flags.conf).

- [ ] add info about automation

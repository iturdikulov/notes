# About me
TODO: very scratchy

I would self-identify as a fan of “procedural programming.”
I worked as a Frontend developer for a few years (actually 7)
I worked as a Python developer for a few years (actually 3)
I have done a fair amount of Linux specific tasks in my free time.
I run Linux Distribution on my personal computer. I use pacman/pikaur as my package manager.
I like Linux the way that some people like Linux, and care about how computers
works at a low level.
I like high-level abstractions and simplicity and building things.
I know some things about computers, how they work on low-level.

My current interests available in [[Now]] note.

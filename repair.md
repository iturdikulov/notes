# Repair

Information for repairing my devices. I'm not really professional in repair, but
I can make some minor repair.

First before repairing my devices I usually check
[iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/), If device is "popular" there should be some
instructions. If there nothing usual, worth to check [[YouTube]] or just
[[search_engine]] things.

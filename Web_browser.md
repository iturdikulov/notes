# Web browser

> A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a
> web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web
> server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a
> range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In
> 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have used a browser. The most used
> browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices,
> followed by Safari with 18%.
>
> A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are
> often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other
> websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages,
> a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts, browsers
> are referred to as user agents.\

Currently, I use [[Firefox]] and [[Brave]].

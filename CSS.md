# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
> presentation of a document written in a markup language such as [[HTML]] or
> XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
> cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside [[HTML]] and
> [[JavaScript]].\
>
> CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
> including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
> accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
> presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
> specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity
> and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be
> cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
> and its formatting.

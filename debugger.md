# Debugger

> A debugger or debugging tool is a [[computer_program]] used to [[software_testing|test]] and debug other programs (the "target" program). The main use of a debugger is to run the target program under ==controlled conditions== that permit the programmer to track its execution and monitor changes in computer resources that may indicate malfunctioning code. Typical debugging facilities include the ability to run or halt the target program at specific points, display the contents of memory, CPU registers or storage devices (such as disk drives), and modify memory or register contents in order to enter selected test data that might be a cause of faulty program execution.\

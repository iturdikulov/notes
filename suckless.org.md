xst is my main program, I usually have [[tmux]] sessions in it.

Some useful shortcuts aviable here: `man -P 'less -p ^SHORTCUTS$' xst`.

Features:

- Loads settings from Xresources.
- Live-reloads settings from xrdb on USR1 signal (like termite)
- Has cursor blinking options (and can persistently blink while typing)
- A keybind ==`M-u`== is used for launching URLs with `dmenu + xurls`.

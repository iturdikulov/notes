# Health and "beauty"

My health is the key of productive and satisfying [[life]]. To be healthy I need to follow some rules, tips, and well-known methods to support my health. Here I collection various things related to health.

> In common usage and medicine, health, according to the World Health Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". A variety of definitions have been used for different purposes over time. Health can be promoted by encouraging healthful activities, such as regular [[my_physical_exercise_plan.ru|physical exercise]] and adequate [[sleep]], and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare services. Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices, such as genetic disorders.\

# Tree (data structure)

> In [[computer_science]], a tree is a widely used [[AST|abstract data type]]
> that represents a hierarchical tree structure with a set of connected nodes.
> Each node in the tree can be connected to many children (depending on the type
> of tree), but must be connected to exactly one parent, except for the root
> node, which has no parent (i.e., the root node as the top-most node in the
> tree hierarchy). These constraints mean there are no cycles or "loops" (no
> node can be its own ancestor), and also that each child can be treated like
> the root node of its own subtree, making recursion a useful technique for tree
> traversal. In contrast to linear data structures, many trees cannot be
> represented by relationships between neighboring nodes (parent and children
> nodes of a node under consideration if they exists) in a single straight line
> (called edge or link between two adjacent nodes).\

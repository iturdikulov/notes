# Slack

> Slack is an [[IM]] program designed by [Slack
> Technologies](https://slack.com/) and owned by Salesforce. Although
> Slack was developed for professional and organizational communications, it has
> also been adopted as a community platform. Users can communicate with **voice
> calls**, **video calls**, text messaging, media, and files in private chats or
> as part of communities called "workspaces." Slack also uses
> [[IRC|IRC-style]] features such as persistent chat rooms
> (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. In
> addition to these online communication features, Slack can integrate with
> other software.\

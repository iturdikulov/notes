# Web browser

> A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a
> web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web
> server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used on a
> range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In
> 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have used a browser. The most used
> browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices,
> followed by Safari with 18%.
>
> A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are
> often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other
> websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages,
> a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts, browsers
> are referred to as user agents.\

Currently, I use and [[Brave]] and [[Firefox]] as fallback browser.

I also recommend checking and integrate [[search_engine|search engines]] into
your browser.

## Development tools

DevTools allowing you edit web pages in live mode, debug [[JavaScript]] code and
examine page source and structure (DOM tree).

Since my primary browser is Brave, I take more attention to Chrome DevTools
details. [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools) are
supported in Brave, so it's recommended to use them for debugging and testing
when working with web development (frontend). Check link above for more
information.

To toggle DevTools press `C-S-i` or `F12`, it will open small window with
previously opened component (specific tab on top). You can also toggle it by
right-clicking on the page element and selecting "Inspect" from the context
menu, or press `C-S-c` to enter into interactive selection mode.

### Shortcuts

Toggle Responsive Design Mode::`C-S-m`

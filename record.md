# Record

> In [[computer_science]], a record (also called a structure, struct, or
> compound data) is a basic [[data_structure]]. Records in a database or
> spreadsheet are usually called "rows".
>
> A record is a ==collection of fields==, possibly of different data types,
> typically in a fixed number and sequence. The fields of a record may also be
> called members, particularly in object-oriented programming; fields may also
> be called elements, though this risks confusion with the elements of a
> collection.
>
> For example, a date could be stored as a record containing a numeric year
> field, a month field represented as a string, and a numeric day-of-month
> field. A personnel record might contain a name, a salary, and a rank. A Circle
> record might contain a center and a radius—in this instance, the center itself
> might be represented as a point record containing x and y coordinates.\

# AdGuard Home

> AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After
> you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any
> client-side software for that. It operates as a DNS server that re-routes
> tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from
> connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public
> AdGuard DNS servers, and both share a lot of code.\

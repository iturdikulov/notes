# Human migration

> Human migration is the movement of people from one place to another with
> intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily, at a new location
> (geographic region). The movement often occurs over long distances and from
> one country to another (external migration), but internal migration (within a
> single country) is also possible; indeed, this is the dominant form of human
> migration globally.
>
> Migration is often associated with better human capital at both individual and
> household level, and with better access to migration networks, facilitating a
> possible second move in their [[In_real_life_IRL|live]].\

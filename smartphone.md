# Smartphone

> A smartphone is a portable [[computer|computer]] device that combines mobile
> telephone functions and computing functions into one unit. They are
> distinguished from older-design feature phones by their stronger hardware
> capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider
> software, access to the internet (including web browsing over mobile
> broadband), and multimedia functionality (including [[my music|music]],
> [[my videos|video]], [[camera|cameras]], and [[my games|gaming#smartphone]]),
> alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging.
>
> Smartphones typically contain a number of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS)
> integrated circuit (IC) chips, include various sensors that can be leveraged
> by pre-installed and third-party software (such as a magnetometer, a proximity
> sensor, a barometer, a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and more), and support
> wireless communication protocols (such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or satellite
> navigation). More recently, smartphone manufacturers have begun to integrate
> satellite messaging connectivity and satellite emergency services into devices
> for use in remote regions where there is no reliable cellular network.

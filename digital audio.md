# Digital audio

> Digital audio is a representation of sound recorded in, or converted into,
> digital form. In digital audio, the sound wave of the audio signal is
> typically encoded as numerical samples in a continuous sequence. For example,
> in CD audio, samples are taken 44,100 times per second, each with 16-bit
> sample depth. Digital audio is also the name for the entire technology of
> sound recording and reproduction using audio signals that have been encoded in
> digital form. Following significant advances in digital audio technology
> during the 1970s and 1980s, it gradually replaced analog audio technology in
> many areas of audio engineering, record production and telecommunications in
> the 1990s and 2000s.
>
> Digital audio technologies are used in the recording, manipulation,
> mass-production, and distribution of sound, including recordings of songs,
> instrumental pieces, podcasts, sound effects, and other sounds. Modern online
> [[my music]] distribution depends on digital recording and data compression.

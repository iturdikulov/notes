# Computer hardware

> Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a [[Computer|computer]], such
> as the case, central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM),
> monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card,
> speakers and motherboard.
>
> By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by
> hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to
> changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.
>
> Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or
> instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing
> system, although other systems exist with only hardware.\

# Do it yourself (DIY)

> "Do it yourself" ("DIY") is the method of building, modifying, or repairing
> things by oneself without the direct aid of professionals or certified
> experts. Academic research has described DIY as behaviors where "individuals
> use raw and semi-raw materials and parts to produce, transform, or reconstruct
> material possessions, including those drawn from the natural environment
> (e.g., landscaping)". DIY behavior can be triggered by various motivations
> previously categorized as marketplace motivations (economic benefits, lack of
> product availability, lack of product quality, need for customization), and
> identity enhancement (craftsmanship, empowerment, community seeking,
> uniqueness).\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself)</cite>

For me DIY is important part of my [[life]].

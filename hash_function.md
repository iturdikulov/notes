# Hash function

> A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size
> to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support
> variable length output. The values returned by a hash function are called hash
> values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are usually used to
> index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index
> a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.\

# Class (computer programming)

> In [[OOP|object-oriented programming]], a class defines the structure, initial state and behavior of an object. An object is created through a process known as instantiation, the creation of an instance of a class. Classes may define members, such as methods and variables, that are local to either the class itself or instances of that class. If the programming language supports inheritance, a class is extensible by allowing the definition of one class to be based on and extended from another.\

# Class (computer programming)

> In [[OOP|object-oriented programming]], a class defines the structure, initial
> state and behavior of an object. An object is created through a process known as
> instantiation, the creation of an instance of a class. Classes may define
> members, such as methods and variables, that are local to either the class
> itself or instances of that class. If the programming language supports
> inheritance, a class is extensible by allowing the definition of one class to be
> based on and extended from another.\

# Operation (mathematics)

> In [[Mathematics|mathematics]], an operation is a [[Function|function]]
> which takes zero or more input values (also called "[[Operand|operands]]" or
> "arguments") to a well-defined output value. The number of operands is the
> ==arity of the operation==.
>
> The most commonly studied operations are binary operations (i.e., operations
> of arity 2), such as addition and multiplication, and unary operations (i.e.,
> operations of arity 1), such as additive inverse and multiplicative inverse.
> An operation of arity zero, or nullary operation, is a constant. The mixed
> product is an example of an operation of arity 3, also called ternary
> operation.
>
> Generally, the arity is taken to be finite. However, infinitary operations are
> sometimes considered, in which case the "usual" operations of finite arity are
> called finitary operations.
>
> A partial operation is defined similarly to an operation, but with a partial
> function in place of a function.\

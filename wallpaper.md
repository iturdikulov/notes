# Wallpaper

> A wallpaper or background (also known as a desktop background, desktop picture
> or desktop image on [[computer|computers]]) is a digital image
> ([[photography|photo]], drawing etc.) used as a decorative background of a
> graphical user interface on the screen of a computer, smartphone or other
> electronic device. On a computer, wallpapers are generally used on the
> desktop, while on a mobile phone they serve as the background for the home
> screen. Though most devices include a default background image, modern devices
> usually allow users to manually change the background image.

> The term "wallpaper" was used in Microsoft Windows before Windows XP (where it
> is called the "desktop background"), while macOS refers to it as "desktop
> picture". On older systems which allowed small repeated patterns to be set as
> background images, the term desktop pattern was used.\

Personally I use simple wallpaper, which can inspire me to do something. I also
prefer native resolution to avoid scaling artifacts.

# My learning path

This is my important place in choosing what to learn for [[my_goals]] and my [[projects]] required skills. These two entities are primary source of my learning materials.

Since I'm use [[Zettelkasten]], I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources and my experience.

My current focus is on following things, order is not important. All with help of [[spaced_repetition]], [[SQ3R_method]], [[Zettelkasten]],
[[how_to_study_or_learn|study techniques]], etc.

I need spent some time each day, enough to learn something new.

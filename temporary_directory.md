# Temporary directory

> In [[computing]], a temporary folder or temporary directory is a directory
> used to hold temporary files. Many operating systems and some software
> automatically delete the contents of this directory at bootup or at regular
> intervals, leaving the directory itself intact.
>
> For security reasons, it is best for each user to have their own temporary
> directory, since there has been a history of security vulnerabilities with
> temporary files due to programs incorrect file permissions or race
> conditions.\

Personally I use it to move files which are not required anymore and can be
deleted in the future. I also have `Inbox` subdirectory here, where I store some
data which I'll process later.

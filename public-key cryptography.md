# Public-key cryptography

> Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of
> cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair consists
> of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are generated with
> cryptographic [[algorithm|algorithms]] based on
> [[mathematics|mathematical]] problems termed one-way functions.
> [[computer security|security]] of public-key cryptography depends
> on keeping the private key secret; the public key can be openly distributed
> without compromising security.

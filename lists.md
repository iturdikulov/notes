# Lists

> There are **three types** of lists: unordered lists, ordered lists, and
> description lists (a.k.a. definition lists or association lists). Ordered
> (numbered) lists should usually be used only for list items that should be in
> a specific order, such as steps in a cooking recipe.\

## Examples

- Lists are easy to do:
  - start every line
- with a dash
  - more spaces and dash mean
    - deeper levels
      - even deeper

1. Numbered lists are good
   1. very organized
   2. easy to follow

I use lists a lot, and good to know some [[English]] grammar rules to follow.

Without punctuation, lists are harder to read, especially when they are long.
Main idea is use consistent punctuation.

Use ";" in bullet-list items probably not good idea, because list item can use
it as separator.

# Proofreading

> Proofreading is an iterative process of comparing galley proofs against the
> original manuscripts or graphic artworks to identify **transcription errors**
> in the typesetting process. In the past, proofreaders would place corrections
> or proofreading marks along the margins. In modern publishing, material is
> generally provided in **electronic form**, traditional typesetting is no
> longer used and thus (in general) this kind of transcription no longer occurs.
> Consequently the part played by pure proofreaders in the process has almost
> vanished: the role has been absorbed into copy editing to such an extent that
> their names have become interchangeable. Modern copy-editors may check layout
> alongside their traditional checks on grammar, punctuation and readability.\

I use digital tools for proofreading, such as
[LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/ru) (with
[valentjn/ltex-ls](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls)) to write grammatically
correct text in [[English]] and [[Russian]].

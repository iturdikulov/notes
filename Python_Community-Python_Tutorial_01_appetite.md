# 1. Whetting Your Appetite

In this section described when Python can be usable. For example scripting,
simple GUI, etc.

Also described strong points of Python, such as rapid development (simplify
write/compile/test/re-compile cycle), interactivity, extensibility, splitting
into modules, simple integration, automatization, batteries-included, difference
between Python and other languages, such as C, C++, Java, etc.

Python is ==[[Interpreter|interpreted]]== language, no compilation and linking
is necessary (but possible). <!--SR:!2024-11-01,3,250-->

Python can be used as glue language, to connect components together.

Difference between [[C]], [[Java]], [[Go]] etc.:
- the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single
statement;
- statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending
brackets;
- no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

components of programming system. <!--SR:!2024-11-01,3,250-->

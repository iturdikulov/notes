# Learning

> Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors,
> skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. The ability to learn is possessed
> by humans, animals, and some machines; there is also evidence for some kind of
> learning in certain plants. Some learning is immediate, induced by a single
> event (e.g. being burned by a hot stove), but much skill and knowledge
> accumulate from ==repeated experiences==. The changes induced by learning
> often last a lifetime, and it is hard to distinguish learned material that
> seems to be "lost" from that which cannot be retrieved.\

My learning goals:

- Unlock potential to solve complex, challenging problems.
- Give me the opportunity to solve engineering problems correctly.
- Make world better with efficient and properly created products.

Learning is the **process**, so don't need too much worry about how much time
you need to learn something or how much time you already spend. Need just focus
on process.

There are tons of learning resources aviable, but you need to chose what to
learn you are interested in and what is the most important for you.

Learning is very tightly connected with practice and
[[spaced_repetition|repetiton]] so after you learn something the best method to
consolidate your knowledge is to practice it and test yourself. Personally I
implement my [[projects]] and [[work|working projects]] to strengthen my
studies.

> The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs

> Repeat the tutorial from memory, notes can help. Experiment, do something new,
> based on tutorials. Make something dirty but get experience.

## My learning path

This is my important place in choosing what to learn for my [[Work#Goals|work
goals]] and my [[projects]] required skills.

Since I'm use [[Zettelkasten]], I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources, my experience, etc.

My current focus is on following things, order is not important. All with help
of [[spaced_repetition]], [[SQ3R_method]], [[Zettelkasten]],
[[how_to_study_or_learn|study techniques]], etc.

I need spent at least 2 hours per day for learning, it's not so much, but it's
enough to learn something new. My actual current learning list is aviable with
`t project:learn` command ([[Taskwarrior]]).

## The Feynman Technique: Master the Art of Learning

Concepts of Feynman Learning technique [^1].

Additionaly I recommend to check very motivational video about same topic (check
part 6 on 55:00):

_The complete FUN TO IMAGINE with Richard Feynman_

Complexity and jargon often mask a lack of understanding.

> Anyone can make a subject complicated but only someone who understands can
> make it simple.

> Simple is beautiful.

Feynman’s learning technique comprises four key steps:

1. Select a concept to learn.
2. Teach it to a child.
3. Review and refine your understanding.
4. Organize your notes and revisit them regularly.

General ideas: understanding the true essence of a concept rather than merely
knowing its name. This learning technique can be applied universally,
irrespective of the subject.

- Step 1: Select a concept to learn.
  What topic are you curious about?
  Take out a blank sheet of paper. Write out everything you already know about the
  subject you want to understand deeper. As you learn more about the topic, add it
  to your sheet. If you use a different color pen as you learn new things, you can
  literally watch your knowledge grow.
  Once you think you understand the topic well enough, move on to step 2.

- Step 2: Teach it to a child.
  Can you explain your chosen concept to a 12-year-old? Test your understanding
  by simplifying your notes. Banish jargon and complexity, using only words a
  child would comprehend. Simplicity reveals a depth of understanding, while
  jargon often conceals ignorance.

- Step 3: Review and Refine.
  Write down your simplified explanation. The act of writing aids reflection and
  learning. In fact, reflection is the most important part of the learning
  process. Reflection is how we learn what we know and what we need to learn.
  Clear writing gives poor thinking nowhere to hide.
  Ensure your notes are free of any jargon or something that sounds confusing.
  If something sounds confusing, it needs more refinement.
  Read it out loud as if to a child. If the explanation isn’t simple enough or
  sounds confusing, that’s a good indication that you need to reflect and refine.
  Go back to the source material, reviewing the parts you don’t quite understand
  yet.
  Repeat until you have a simple explanation.

- Step 4: Organize and Review.
  To test your understanding in the real world, present your explanation to
  someone else. How effective was your explanation? What questions did they ask?
  What parts did they get confused about?
  When you’re happy with your understanding, take the page you created with a
  simple explanation and put it into a binder. Following this technique for
  everything you learn gives you a binder full of learning that you can review a
  couple of times a year.

Simplicity is the hallmark of true understanding. Challenge others who use
jargon to explain concepts in simple terms, and their reactions may reveal their
comprehension (or lack thereof).

## Fundamentals of science and computer science

[[science|Science]] is source of knowledge and predictions about the world, and
I want to learn it better. My main focus is on fundamental sciences and
especially [[computer_science]]. I'll describe my learning paths for each field
in this section.

**[[computer_science#Computer science learning path|How I learn computer science]]**.
Computer science help me to understand my profession (software engineer) better
and break my barriers in software development.

[[mathematics#Mathematics learning path|How I learn mathematics]]. Mathematics
is a "clean" fundamental science, and part of many others, and I want to learn
it better, at least on some beginner/medium level.

[[physics#Physics learning path|physics]] and
[[chemistry#Chemistry learning path|chemistry]] go after mathematics in my
learning priority. I want to understand world better, and this fields can help
me with it.

Linguistics, my primary focus is [[Russian#Russian learning path|Russian]] and
[[English#English learning path|English]] languages. English is great to reveal
huge part of world, new knowledge and opportunities, I'm native Russian speaker,
currently I spent more time to learn English.

Knowing [[history]] is improving your understanding of current world events and
help to avoid mistakes from past.

## Programming and software development

Programming and software development are very deeply linked with science, and
computer science in particular. It's a little bit different from
science/computer science, because it's more practical and applied, but in fact
it uses all from them. This is also my current [[work]] and main source of
[[projects]].

[[computer_programming#Programming learning path|Programming learning path]].
This is place where I store programming applied learning materials, related
outline notes (like frontend/backend) and some management stuff.

My editing workflow, including [[code]], is heavily related to [[Neovim]], but
it can be replicated in some advanced code editor (like [[Pycharm]]), check
these notes for more information. I also keep collecting various useful
information, which can be related to various software, like
[[keyboard_shortcut]], [[Blender]], [[Krita]], [[GNU_Utilities]], [[Linux]],
[[NixOS]], etc.

[[computer_graphics#Computer graphics learning path|Computer graphics]] impress
me, and I want to learn more about it. It's a great way to express my thoughts
in easy to understand form.

[[my_awesome_software_list|My awesome software list]] is subset of endlessly
large software list, which I use for my work and personal life. In fact this is
sort of my tools list.

## Productivity

[[my_productivity_workflow|My productivity workflow]] is about how I manage my
time, tasks, etc. It's very useful to learn how to manage your time and tasks
better.

## Art

[[art#Art learning path]] is a great way to express my thoughts in easy to understand form.
Art for me is also deeply integrated into [[computer_graphics]], because it
provides many opportunities to create something beautiful.

I organize all **my** art related stuff in [[art]] note.

# Learning

This is my important place in choosing what to learn for my [[Work#Goals|work
goals]] and my [[my_pet_projects|pet projects]] required skills.

Since I'm use [[Zettelkasten]], I can create new notes based on education
materials and extend them with different sources, my experience, etc. That
materials have `research` tag.

My current focus is on following things, order is not important. All with help
of [[spaced_repetition|spaced repetition]], [[SQ3R_method|Sq3R]],
[[Zettelkasten|Zettelkasten]], [[how_to_study_or_learn|study techniques]], etc.

It's not enough to study only, need continuously practice (use your knowledge)
and test yourself, to solve this problem I implement my
[[my_pet_projects|pet projects]] and [[work|working projects]] to strengthen my
studies.

## My focus in learning

- [[how_I_learn_programming_and_software_development|Programming and Software development]]
- [[how_I_learn_physics_and_chemistry|Physics and Chemistry]]
- [[how_I_learn_computer_graphics|Computer graphics]]
- [[how_I_learn_computer_science|Computer Science]]
- [[how_I_learn_mathematics|Mathematics]]
- [[how_I_learn_English|English]]
- [[how_I_learn_art|Art]]

And below I breafly describe them.

## Fundamentals of science and computer science

[[science]] is source of knowledge and predictions about the world, and I want
to learn it better. My main focus is on fundamental sciences and especially
[[computer_science|computer science]]. I'll describe my learning paths for each
field in this section.

**[[how_I_learn_computer_science|How I learn computer science]]**.
Computer science help me to understand my profession (software engineer) better
and break my barriers in software development.

[[how_I_learn_mathematics|How I learn mathematics]]. Mathematics is a "clean"
fundamental science, and part of many others, and I want to learn it better, at
least on some beginner/medium level.

[[how_I_learn_physics_and_chemistry|How I learn physics and chemistry]].
[[physics]] and [[chemistry]] go after mathematics in my learning priority. I
want to understand world better, and this fields can help me with it.

Linguistics, my primary focus is [[Russian]] and [[English]] languages. English
is great to reveal huge part of world, new knowledge and opportunities, I'm
native [[Russian|Russian]] speaker, currently I spent more time to learn
English. [[how_I_learn_English|How I learn English]].

Knowing [[history|history]] is improving your understanding of current world
events and help to avoid mistakes from past.

## Programming and software development

Programming and software development are very deeply linked with science, and
computer science in particular. It's a little bit different from
science/computer science, because it's more practical and applied, but in fact
it uses all from them. This is also my current [[work|work]] and main source of
[[my_pet_projects|pet projects]].

[[how_I_learn_programming_and_software_development|How I learn programming and software development]].
This is place where I store programming applied learning materials, related
outline notes (like frontend/backend) and some management stuff.

My editing workflow, including [[code]], is heavily related to [[Neovim]],
but it can be replicated in some advanced code editor (like [[Pycharm]]), check
these notes for more information. I also keep collecting various useful
information, which can be related to various software, like
[[keyboard_shortcut|keyboard shortcuts]], [[Blender]], [[Krita]],
[[GNU_Utilities]], [[GNU_Linux]], [[NixOS]], etc.

[[how_I_learn_computer_graphics|How I learn computer graphics]]. Computer
graphics impress me, and I want to learn more about it. It's a great way to
express my thoughts in easy to understand form.

[[my_awesome_software_list|My awesome software list]] is subset of endlessly
large software list, which I use for my work and personal life. In fact this is
sort of my tools list.

## Other

[[my_productivity_workflow|My productivity workflow]] is about how I manage my
time, tasks, etc. It's very useful to learn how to manage your time and tasks
better.

## Art

[[art|Art]] is a great way to express my thoughts in easy to understand form.
Art for me is also deeply integrated into computer graphics, because it provides
many opportunities to create something beautiful. Here is my
[[how_I_learn_art|learning path]].

I organize all **my** art related stuff in [[my_art|my art]] note.

[[literature]] for me is great solution to fun and relax. I collect my reading
list and favorite books in [[my_fiction_books|my fiction books]] note.

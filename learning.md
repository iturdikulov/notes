# Learning

Learning is special process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and preferences. To learn something you usually need to repeat something, so knowledge accumulate from ==repeated== experiences.[^1]

My learning [[my_goals#Goal 1 Become an effective programmer|goals]]:

- Unlock my potential to solve complex, challenging problems.
- Give me the opportunity to solve engineering problems correctly.
- Make world better with efficient and properly created products.

Learning is the **process**, so don't need too much worry about how much time you need to learn something or how much time you already spend. Need just focus on process, make it fun. I [[how_to_study_or_learn|collect]] best practices to learn. Check also great interview-based [[Feynman_-_Master_the_Art_of_Learning]] notes.

There are tons of learning resources available, but you need to chose what to learn you are interested in and what is the most important for you ([[img/eisenhower_matrix.excalidraw|eisenhower_matrix]]).

Learning is very tightly connected with practice and [[spaced_repetition|repetition]] so after you learn something the best method to consolidate your knowledge is to practice it and test yourself. Personally I implement my [[projects]] and [[work|working projects]] to strengthen my studies.

> Repeat the tutorial from memory, notes can help. Experiment, do something new, based on tutorials. Make something dirty but get experience.\

I keep tracking my learning experience in [[my_learning_path]] note.

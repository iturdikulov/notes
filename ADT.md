# Abstract data type (ADT)

> In [[computer_science]], an abstract data type (ADT) is a
> [[mathematical_model]] for [[data_structure#Data types|data type]]. An
> abstract data type is defined by its behavior (semantics) from the point of
> view of a user, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values,
> possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these
> operations. This mathematical model contrasts with data structures, which are
> concrete representations of data, and are the point of view of an implementer,
> not a user.\

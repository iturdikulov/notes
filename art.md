Art - various human activity and it's resulting product, that include
imaginative, creative talent.

Art expresses technical proficiency, beauty, emotional power and conceptual
ideas.

For me Art is sort of self-expression, when I have a need to express my thoughts
or just "creative copy" something beautiful.

I'm fan of traditional [[visual_art]] and CGI art. I have my
[[art#Art learning path|study plan]] to understand art and their subfields
better.

## Art learning path

Currently, I'm focusing on learning [[visual_art]] and [[photography]],
additionally I'm learning
[[computer_graphics#Computer Graphics learning path|computer graphics]] which is
for me very close field.

I also like to practice [[my_handwriting|handwriting]].

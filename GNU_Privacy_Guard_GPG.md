# GNU Privacy Guard (GPG or GnuPG)

> Free-software replacement for Symantec's PGP cryptographic software
> suite. The software is compliant with RFC 4880, the IETF standards-track
> specification of OpenPGP. Modern versions of PGP are interoperable with
> GnuPG and other OpenPGP-compliant systems.
>
> GnuPG is part of the GNU Project and received major funding from the
> German government in 1999.
>
> GnuPG is a hybrid-encryption software program because it uses a
> combination of conventional symmetric-key cryptography for speed, and
> [[public-key_cryptography|public-key cryptography]] for ease of secure
> key exchange, typically by using the recipient's public key to encrypt a
> session key which is used only once. This mode of operation is part of
> the OpenPGP standard and has been part of PGP from its first version.
>
> The GnuPG 1.x series uses an integrated cryptographic library, while the
> GnuPG 1.x series replaces this with Libgcrypt.\

## Basic commands

You can generate GPG key with `gpg --generate-key` command.
Or `gpg --full-generate-key --expert` for more options.

If you use NixOS installer, you may need to temporarily install GnuPG and
`pinentry-curses`:
```
nix-shell -p gnupg pinentry-curses
gpg --pinentry-mode loopback ...
```

To check GPG keys, installed on your system run `gpg --list-key`.

To export public key with specific email,
run `gpg --output <path/key_name.gpg> --export --armor <email>`.

To export private key with specific email,
run `gpg --output <path/key_name.gpg> --export-secret-key --armor <email>`.

If required backup, recommended using this command:
`gpg --output <path/key_name.gpg> --armor --export-secret-keys \
--export-options export-backup <email>`

If required, you can trust your own key with this algorithm:
1. `gpg --edit-key <email>`
2. `trust`
3. `5` (ultimate trust, in our case)
4. `y` (yes)
5. `quit`

## Subkeys Usage

Being able to store the primary key **offline or a more secure device**. If
a machine with a subkey is harmed, you can easily revoke the subkey without
all the hassles of revoking your primary key (sharing a new key, getting
new signatures, ...).

Usually master key can have only this access rights:
 - `C` (Certify)
 - `S` (Sign)

Subkeys can have:
 - `E` (Encrypt)
 - `A` (Authenticate)

Having different subkeys on different machines, for example a signing
subkey on a build server. Again, revoking single keys is easy.

Using a larger primary key for long lifetime, and shorter, but faster
subkeys for day-to-day usage.

Some algorithms do not support both encrypting and signing. For example, a
DSA primary key requires another key for encryption, typically paired with
ElGamal.

### Adding subkey

```bash
gpg --edit-key YOUR_KEYGRIP # find keygrip by `gpg -K --with-keygrip`
> addkey
> ECC ... # I prefer ECC keys (elliptic curve cryptography), such as ed25519
> set password ...
> save
```

## GnuPG backup steps

First, before we begin, your@id.here represents your GPG key ID. This could
be your email address or the key ID.

Indeed, your private key is critical, but other files are also important.

If you want save your user attributes, signatures (including local
signatures), and ownertrust values use `--export-options backup` on export
and `--import-options restore` on import.

1. Export keys and ownertrust:

These commands are intended to export your keys and trust level. Public and
private keys are used for encryption/decryption, and the trust level
determines how much you trust other keys in your keyring.

Run the following commands in your command line (Command Prompt for
Windows, Terminal for macOS and Linux). Replace "your@id.here" with your
GPG key ID:

```bash
# First get your keys list with keygrips
gpg -k

# --armor option to, in order to create an ASCII version of the key that is
# not binary and readable

# In order to save all the Public Keys we have imported to our system, we
# need to backup them. The Public Keys are saved at the
# ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx and ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg files. But we do need to
# backup the files directly, it is better to use the --export option.
export KEYGRIP=0X1234567890ABCDEF...
gpg --output "${KEYGRIP}_public.pub" --export --armor $KEYGRIP

# Export private key Note: Although the exported Private Key is encrypted
# with your passphrase, be very carefull with this file, as if it gets
# compromised and brute-forced, anyone can impersonate you and read all
# your encrypted files and emails.
gpg --export-secret-keys --armor --output "${KEYGRIP}_private.asc" $KEYGRIP
gpg --export-secret-subkeys --armor --output "${KEYGRIP}_private_sub.asc" $KEYGRIP

# The GPG Trust Database is used to keep the trust values for each of the
# Public Keys you have.
gpg --export-ownertrust > all_keys_ownertrust.txt

# ~/.gnupg/openpgp-revocs.d/ This is the directory where gpg stores
# pre-generated revocation certificates. The file name corresponds to the
# OpenPGP fingerprint of the respective key. It is suggested to backup
# those certificates and if the primary private key is not stored on the
# disk to move them to an external storage device. Anyone who can access
# these files is able to revoke the corresponding key. You may want to
# print them out. You should backup all files in this directory and take
# care to keep this backup closed away.

# Generate revoke key
gpg --gen-revoke --armor --output "${KEYGRIP}_revoke.asc" $KEYGRIP
```

2. Import keys and ownertrust:

If you need to restore your keys and trust level (e.g., after reinstalling
the system or on a new computer), use the following commands:

WARNING: import keys without ssh-agent, for example not through ssh connection
(otherwise there possible issues if used NOT pinentry-curses) and set correct
`~/.config/gnupg/` permissions (`700`).

```bash
gpg --import ..._public.pub
gpg --import ..._private.asc
gpg --import ..._private_sub.asc

# NOTE: To import the Trust Database, we need to first delete the current
# one: rm ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg
gpg --import-ownertrust ownertrust.txt
```

3. Ultimately trust the imported key (optional if ownertrust is not
   imported):

This step is needed to set the ultimate trust level for your keys. Run the
following command, then type trust, then 5 (which means "ultimate trust")
and hit Enter:

```bash
gpg --edit-key your@id.here gpg> trust Your decision? 5 Note: If you're
```

4. Import revocation certificate (optional, if you need revoke key):

```bash
echo -n "-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Comment: This is a revocation certificate

....
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----" | gpg --import -
```

5. Delete keys (optional!)

```bash
gpg -k
gpg --delete-keys ...
gpg --delete-secret-keys ...
gpg -k
```

If you want to delete the Private Key file you created, you can use the
[[Shred]] utility to delete the file permanently and make it harder to be
recovered by overwriting it:

```bash
# The shred options, do the following:
#
# z: add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding
# u: de-allocate and remove file after overwriting
# v: show progress

shred -zuv privatekey.asc
```

## GnuPG to SSH

1. Find fingerprint of your RSA key:
   `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format short` or `gpg -K`
2. Next, you can use openpgp2ssh tool distributed in with monkeyshpere project:
```bash
# 01234567 must be fingerprint of a RSA key (or subkey)
# gpg --export-secret-keys also accept finger print of global key  (in this
# case, it exports all sub-keys). However, openpgp2ssh only accept finger
# print of an RSA key If no arguments are provided, openpgp2ssh export RSA
# keys it find
gpg --export-secret-keys (or --export-secret-subkeys) 01234567! | openpgp2ssh 01234567 > id_rsa
```
3. You can now extract ssh public key using: `ssh-keygen -y -f id_rsa > id_rsa.pub`


## Uploading the key to keyserver

This section explains how to upload your public key to a keyserver so that
anyone can download it. Once you have uploaded it to one keyserver, it will
propagate to the other keyservers. Eventually most of the keyservers will
have a copy of your key. You can accelerate the process by uploading your
key to several keyservers.

To upload the key, enter:

```bash
# get key id
gpg --list-keys --keyid-format short
export GPGKEY=01234567
gpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com $GPGKEY
```


Note that keyserver.ubuntu.com is only reachable via IPv4.

## Test GnuPG

You can quickly test encrypt/decrypt commands with this command:
```
echo "test"|gpg -r example@domain.tld --encrypt|gpg --decrypt --no-comment -q --no-verbose
# output should be "test"
```

A useful gpg option to experiment is `--homedir`:

```bash
gpg --homedir ~/tmp --list-keys
# Or alternatively use GNUPGHOME
export GNUPGHOME=~/tmp
gpg --list-keys
```
This way your default keyring, trust database, etc. get ignored, and you
have a fresh keyring with which you can test if the conversion/import was
successful.

## Fix permissions

To fix the `gpg: WARNING: unsafe permissions on homedir
'/home/path/to/user/.gnupg'` error

```bash
chown -R $(whoami) ~/.gnupg/

# Also correct the permissions and access rights on the directory
chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/*
chmod 700 ~/.gnupg
```

### Key servers list:

- [OpenPGP Keyserver](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/). Ubuntu keyserver:
federated, no verification, keys cannot be deleted.
- [Mailvelope Key Server](https://keys.mailvelope.com/) Mailvelope
keyserver: central, verification of email IDs, keys can be deleted.
- [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/). Central, verification of
email IDs, keys can be deleted, no third-party signatures (i.e. no Web of
Trust support).

## How to import an SSH ed25519 key to GPG?

1. First you need [[SSH#Generate ed25519 ssh key|generate]] or
   use existing key.
2. Setup gpg-agent with ssh support
3. Add your SSH private key to GPG by `ssh-add ed25519-filename`. NOTE:
   that if you are asked for a new password, it is recommended that you use
   the same as your GPG master password.
4. Check keygrips `gpg -K --with-keygrip`

Assume that you have already setup `gpg-agent`.

1. Setup `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and `GPG_TTY` environment variables by
`export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)` and
`export GPG_TTY=$(tty)`.
This optional, usually I have gpg-agent with ssh support.
2. Add your SSH private key to GPG by `ssh-add ed25519-filename`.
NOTE: that if you are asked for a new password, it is recommended that you
use the same as your GPG master password.
3. Identify the keygrip of the private key that you added by step 2.
  1. Check the keygrips of your existing GPG private keys by `gpg -K --with-keygrip`.
  2. Check private key files by `ls -l $(gpgconf --list-dirs homedir)/private-keys-v1.d`.
  3. The filename of step 3.2. that is not in the keygrips of step 3-1 is
     the keygrip that you added by step 2.
4.  Setup the key added by `ssh-add` to a subkey.
  1. Start GPG by `gpg --expert --edit-key "Your-existing-GPG-Key-ID"`.
  2. Enter `addkey` command.
  3. Select "Existing key". (Maybe "13")
  4. Enter the keygrip identified by step 3.
  5. Set the capability as you wish and Finish.
  6. Then, answer the questions appropriately.
     Note that you should answer `Y` to `Really create?` and `Save changes?` etc.
5. Verify that the import was successful by `gpg -K --with-keygrip`.
 You should be able to see the keygrip that you just added.

## Offline master key strategy

Based on guide, how to manage primary GnuPG key offline [^1].

1. Store your master key on some offline resources, such as USB stick (for
example in encrypted container). To achieve this you can export your keys
and validate them on another machine, which is not connected to internet.

2. Remove master key from keyring (guide for GnuPG 2.1)

BEFORE DELETE MASTER KEY, CHECK THAT YOU HAVE A BACKUP OF IT!
WHICH GENERATED IN PREVIOUS STEP!

```bash
# usualy need to find key with uid/first one, `sec ... [SC]`
gpg2 --list-secret-keys --with-keygrip
gpg-connect-agent "DELETE_KEY MASTER_KEY_KEYGRIP" /bye
```

Ensure that the private master key has been removed, `gpg2
--list-secret-keys`, you will see `sec#` instead of `sec`, or try to add
`adduid` for validation.

3. Use the offline master key
Follow [[dm-crypt#Create/mount encrypted file container]] guide to open
storage with master key with specific directory.

And work with master key in this directory.

```bash
# Import backup key
mkdir ~/gpgtmp
gpg2 --homedir ~/gpgtmp --import my-mount-point/key.asc

# Run GPG editor
# In the editor, use uid n to choose an identity of interest, followed by
# sign to sign selected identity with a local key .
gpg2 --homedir ~/gpgtmp --keyring ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx  --no-default-keyring --edit-key bob@example.com
...
gpg-connect-agent --homedir ~/gpgtmp KILLAGENT /bye # kill gpg agent
cp sub-key.asc /media/storage/ # copy sub-key to storage
# umount storage, buy following guide above
```

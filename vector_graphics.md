# Vector graphics

> Vector graphics is a form of [[computer_graphics]] in which visual images are
> created directly from geometric shapes defined on a Cartesian plane, such as
> points, lines, curves and [[polygon|polygons]]. The associated mechanisms may
> include vector display and printing hardware, vector data models and file
> formats, as well as the [[Inkscape|software]] based on these data models
> (especially graphic design software, computer-aided design, and geographic
> information systems). Vector graphics is an alternative to raster or bitmap
> graphics, with each having advantages and disadvantages in specific
> situations.\

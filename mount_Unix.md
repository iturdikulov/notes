# Mount

> In [[computing]], mount is a command in various operating systems.
> Before a user can access a file on a Unix-like machine, the file system on the
> device which contains the file needs to be mounted with the mount command.
> Frequently mount is used for SD card, USB storage, DVD and other removable
> storage devices. The command is also available in the EFI shell.\

I use special `mounter` script, which can be invoked by `<S-C-m>` key
combination. And then I can mount any device into `~/Media/*` directories.

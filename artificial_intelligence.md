# Artificial intelligence (AI)

Sort of [[computer_program]] which mimics human cognition.

> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as
> opposed to intelligence of humans and other animals. Example tasks in which
> this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between
> (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
>
> AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search),
> recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding
> human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo and
> Tesla), generative or creative tools ([[ChatGPT]] and AI art), automated
> decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems
> (such as chess and Go).
>
> Goals: The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been
> broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or
> capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The
> traits described below have received the most attention.
>
> - Reasoning, problem-solving
> - Knowledge representation
> - Learning
> - Natural language processing
> - Perception
> - Social intelligence
> - General intelligence
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)</cite>

> An extreme goal of AI research is to create computer programs that can learn,
> solve problems, and think logically. In practice, however, most applications
> have picked on problems which computers can do well. Searching databases and
> doing calculations are things computers do better than people. On the other
> hand, "perceiving its environment" in any real sense is way beyond present-day
> computing.\

Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models
([[large_language_model|LLMs]]) that generate text based on the semantic
relationships between words in sentences.

NO, in some ways yes and can demonstrate intelegence-like behavior. TODO: write

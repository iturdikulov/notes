# Dijkstra's algorithm

> Dijkstra's algorithm (/ˈdaɪkstrəz/ DYKE-strəz) is an algorithm for finding the
> ==**shortest paths**== between nodes in a weighted graph, which may represent,
> for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist Edsger W.
> Dijkstra in 1956 and published three years later. \

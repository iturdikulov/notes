# Language family

Group of languages which related to some parental language, called the
protolanguage of that family. Actual language, is end node of the language tree.

> A language family is a group of languages related through descent from a
> common ancestral language or parental language, called the proto-language of
> that family. The term "family" reflects the tree model of language origination
> in historical linguistics, which makes use of a metaphor comparing languages
> to people in a biological family tree, or in a subsequent modification, to
> species in a phylogenetic tree of evolutionary taxonomy.\

# Encyclopedia

> An encyclopedia (American English) or encyclopædia (British English) is a
> reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general
> or special to a particular field or discipline. Encyclopedias are
> divided into articles or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article
> name or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable.
> Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most
> dictionaries. Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual
> information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is
> unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words,
> such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms.\

I store some encyclopedias in `.zim` format, which can be opened in [[Kiwix]].

# WireGuard

> WireGuard is an extremely simple yet fast and modern [[VPN]] that utilizes
> state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more
> useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be
> considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general
> purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit
> for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it
> is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely
> deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be
> regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the
> industry.
>
> A combination of extremely high-speed cryptographic primitives and the fact
> that WireGuard lives inside the [[Linux]] kernel means that secure networking
> can be very high-speed. It is suitable for both small embedded devices like
> [[smartphone|smartphones]] and fully loaded backbone routers.\

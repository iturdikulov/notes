# History of life

> The [[History|history ]] of life on Earth traces the processes by which living
> and fossil organisms evolved, from the earliest emergence of life to present
> day. Earth formed about ==4.5 billion== years ago (abbreviated as Ga, for
> gigaannum) and evidence suggests that life emerged prior to 3.7 Ga. Although
> there is some evidence of life as early as 4.1 to 4.28 Ga, it remains
> controversial due to the possible non-biological formation of the purported
> fossils.\

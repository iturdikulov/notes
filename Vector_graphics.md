> visual images are created directly from geometric shapes defined on a
> Cartesian plane, such as points, lines, curves and [[Polygon|polygons]]. The
> associated mechanisms may include vector display and printing hardware, vector
> data models and file formats, as well as the [[Inkscape|software ]] based on
> these data models (especially graphic design software, computer-aided design,
> and geographic information systems). Vector graphics is an alternative to
> raster or bitmap graphics, with each having advantages and disadvantages in
> specific situations.\

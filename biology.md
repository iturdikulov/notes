# Biology

> Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural [[science]] with a
> broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a single,
> coherent field. For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that process
> hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future
> generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and
> diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it allows
> organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all organisms are able to
> regulate their own internal environments.\

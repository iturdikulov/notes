# Cache (computing)

> In computing, a cache (/kæʃ/ i KASH) is a hardware or [[computer_software]]
> component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served
> faster; the data stored in a cache might be the result of an earlier
> computation or a copy of data stored elsewhere. A cache hit occurs when the
> requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it
> cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster
> than recomputing a result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more
> requests that can be served from the cache, the faster the system performs.\

# Linked data structure

> In [[computer_science]], a linked data structure is a [[data_structure]] which
> consists of a set of data records ([[node|nodes]]) linked together and
> organized by references (links or pointers). The link between data can also be
> called a connector.
>
> In linked data structures, the links are usually treated as special data types
> that can only be dereferenced or compared for equality. Linked data structures
> are thus contrasted with arrays and other data structures that require
> performing arithmetic operations on pointers. This distinction holds even when
> the nodes are actually implemented as elements of a single array, and the
> references are actually array indices: as long as no arithmetic is done on
> those indices, the data structure is essentially a linked one.\

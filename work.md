# Work (human activity)

Work is activity to support personal needs, others needs or a wider community. This activity contributes the goods and services within an economy and it's socially beneficial.

Work activity vary, it can be gathering natural resources by hand to operating complex technologies. Personally I usually engage in [[backend]] development.

All but the simplest tasks also require [[my_career#Programmer|specific skills]], [[computer|equipment,]] or [[my_awesome_software_list|tools]], and other resources (such as material for manufacturing goods).

As humans are diurnal, they work mainly [[my_routine|during the day]].

To work [[my_productivity_workflow|efficiently]] and beneficially I need first to make sure that works follows [[my_goals]] and choose work based on [[my_career#Career Plan|career plan]].

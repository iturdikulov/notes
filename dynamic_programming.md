# Dynamic programming

> Dynamic [[computer_programming|programming]] is both a
> [[mathematics|mathematical]] optimization method and a computer programming
> method. The method was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s and has found
> applications in numerous fields, from aerospace engineering to economics.
>
> In both contexts it refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it
> down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive manner. While some decision
> problems cannot be taken apart this way, decisions that span several points in
> time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, in [[computer_science]], if a
> problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then
> recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then it is said
> to have optimal substructure.\

> Dynamic programming is a method of solving problems, which is used in computer
> science, mathematics and economics. Using this method, a complex problem is
> split into simpler problems, which are then solved. At the end, the solutions
> of the simpler problems are used to find the solution of the original complex
> problem.
>
> Dynamic programming can be used in cases where it is possible to split a
> problem into smaller problems, which are all quite similar.\

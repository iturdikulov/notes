# Runtime or execution time (program lifecycle phase)

> In [[computer_science]], runtime, run time, or execution time is the **final
> phase** of a computer program's life cycle, in which the **code is being
> executed** on the computer's central processing unit (CPU) as machine code. In
> other words, "runtime" is the running phase of a program.
>
> A [[runtime_error_detection|runtime error]] is detected after or during the
> execution (running state) of a program, whereas a compile-time error is
> detected by the compiler before the program is ever executed

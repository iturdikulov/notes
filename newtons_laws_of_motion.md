# Newton's laws of motion

Explain Newton's laws of motion.
&#10;<br>
> Three basic laws of [[classical_mechanics]] that describe the relationship
> between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. These laws can be
> paraphrased as follows:
>
> 1. A body remains at rest, or in motion at a constant speed in a straight
>    line, unless acted upon by a force.
> 2. When a body is acted upon by a force, the time rate of change of its
>    momentum equals the force.
> 3. If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces have the same
>    magnitude but opposite directions.\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion)</cite>

TODO: completely understand the three laws of motion.

# Getting Things Done (GTD)

> Getting Things Done (GTD) is a way of organizing all the things a person has
> to do. The method was made by David Allen. He has written a book about this
> subject, with the title of his method.
>
> The Getting Things Done method follows a simple rule: by writing down all
> tasks your mind is free to focus on the task at hand. In this way, the mind
> does not have to remember all the things he still has to do.

I like ideas of GTD productivity system. I not read the book, but I use daily
GTD method.

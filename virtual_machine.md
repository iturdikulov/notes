# Virtual machine

> In [[computing]], a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization or
> emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on
> [[computer_architecture|computer architectures]] and provide the functionality
> of a physical [[computer]]. Their implementations may involve specialized
> hardware, software, or a combination of the two. Virtual machines differ and
> are organized by their function, shown here:
>
> - System virtual machines (also called full virtualization VMs) provide a
>   substitute for a real machine. They provide the functionality needed to
>   execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to
>   share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments that are
>   isolated from one another yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern
>   hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, with
>   virtualization-specific hardware features on the host CPUs providing
>   assistance to hypervisors.
>
> - Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a
>   platform-independent environment.
>
> Some virtual machine emulators, such as QEMU and video game console emulators,
> are designed to also emulate (or "virtually imitate") different system
> architectures, thus allowing execution of software applications and operating
> systems written for another CPU or architecture. OS-level virtualization
> allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel. The terms
> are not universally interchangeable.\

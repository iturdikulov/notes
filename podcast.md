# Podcast

> A podcast is a [[computer_program]] made available in digital format for
> download over the [[internet]]. For example, an episodic series of
> [[digital_audio]] files that a user can download to a personal device to
> listen to at a time of their choosing. Podcasts are primarily an audio medium,
> with some programs offering a supplemental video component. Streaming
> applications and podcasting services provide a convenient and integrated way
> to manage a personal consumption queue across many podcast sources and
> playback devices. There are also podcast search engines, which help users find
> and share podcast episodes.\

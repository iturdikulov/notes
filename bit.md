# Bit

> The bit is the most basic unit of information in [[computing]] and
> digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit. The bit
> represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are
> most commonly represented as either "1" or "0", but other representations such
> as true/false, yes/no, on/off, or +/− are also widely used.\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit)</cite>

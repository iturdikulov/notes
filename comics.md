# Comics

[[media (communication)|medium]] used to express ideas with images,
often combined with text or other visual information. It typically takes the
form of a sequence of panels of images. Textual devices such as speech balloons,
captions, and onomatopoeia can indicate dialogue, narration, sound effects, or
other information. There is no consensus amongst theorists and historians on a
definition of comics; some emphasize the combination of images and text, some
sequentiality or other image relations, and others historical aspects such as
mass reproduction or the use of recurring characters.

# Internet Protocol

> The Internet Protocol (IP) is the [[computer_network|network]] layer
> communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams
> across network boundaries. Its routing function enables internetworking, and
> essentially establishes the [[internet|internet]].
>
> IP has the task of delivering packets from the source host to the destination
> host solely based on the [[IP_address|ip_addresses]] in the packet headers.
> For this purpose, IP defines packet structures that encapsulate the data to be
> delivered. It also defines addressing methods that are used to label the
> datagram with source and destination information.\

# Logarithm

> Part of [[mathematics]]. They are related to exponential
> functions. A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a
> certain number, so logarithms are the inverse of ==exponentiation==.
> Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.

Logarithm it's inverse of ==exponents==. <!--SR:!2024-09-12,9,216-->

$log_{2}(1024)$ means, I need to get a number X, where $2^{X} = 1024$, and
result is ==$10$==. Here $2^{10}$ is exponent and $log_{2}(1024)$ is inverse of
exponent. <!--SR:!2024-09-08,4,161-->

One method of finding logarithm is dividing number until we get a 1 as result,
for example, how to find $log_{2}(2048)$ with this method?
&#10;
How many times need to divide **2** to get 1 as result $2048 \div 2 \div 2 \div
2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 = 1$. So answer is 11. <!--SR:!2024-09-14,11,218-->

In computer science, unlike in math when we're saying $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, we
actually shorthand for saying ==$\mathcal{O}(\log_2 N)$==. <!--SR:!2024-09-20,10,215-->

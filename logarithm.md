# Logarithm

> Part of [[mathematics]]. They are related to exponential functions. A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse of ==exponentiation==. Historically, they were useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers. - <cite>[Simple English Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm)</cite> <!--SR:!2025-08-18,21,218-->

> Logarithms are the inverse operation of exponentiation. We can use logarithms to find the ==exponent==, to which a given base number must be raised in order to produce a particular result.\

Logarithm it's inverse of ==exponents==. <!--SR:!2025-08-16,19,216-->

$log_{2}(1024)$ means, I need to get a number X, where $2^{X} = 1024$, and result is ==$10$==. Here $2^{10}$ is exponent and $log_{2}(1024)$ is inverse of exponent. <!--SR:!2025-08-03,6,161-->

One method of finding logarithm is dividing number until we get a 1 as result, for example, how to find $log_{2}(2048)$ with this method?
<br class="f">
How many times need to divide **2** to get 1 as result $2048 \div 2 \div 2 \div
2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 \div 2 = 1$. So answer is 11. <!--SR:!2025-08-21,24,218-->

In computer science, unlike in math when we're saying $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, we actually shorthand for saying ==$\mathcal{O}(\log_2 N)$==. <!--SR:!2025-08-19,22,215-->

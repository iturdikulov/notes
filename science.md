> ## Scientific method
>
> The scientific method is the name given to the methods used by scientists to
> find knowledge. The main features of the scientific method are:
>
> Scientists identify a question or a problem about nature. Some problems are
> simple, such as "how many legs do flies have?" and some are very deep, such as
> "why do objects fall to the ground?" Next, scientists investigate the problem.
> They work at it, and collect facts. Sometimes all it takes is to look
> carefully. Some questions cannot be answered directly. Then scientists suggest
> ideas, and test them out. They do experiments and collect data. Eventually,
> they find what they think is a good answer to the problem. Then they tell
> people about it. Later, other scientists may agree or not agree. They may
> suggest another answer. They may do more experiments. Anything in science
> might be revised if we find out the previous solution was not good enough.
>
> In other words science is what we do to find out about the natural world.\

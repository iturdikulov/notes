# ArchiveBox

Self-hosted internet archiving solution. I tried to use it, but I found it a
little overcomplicated, and it's not solving some mine specific problems.

And I avoided using it, and instead I'm going to build my own archiving
solution, based on [[SingleFile_CLI]], [[chromium]] PDF printing and Postlight
Parser based HTML DOM dump.

TODO: implement/write own note

## TODO

- [ ] archive external resources from my wiki > less than 100 mb?

# Boot sector

Usualy it's very first sector of the disk.

## Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)

Does not rely on boot sectors, instead it uses bootloaders (EFI application file
from EFI partition or even USB device).

UEFI support code signing, so it's possible to verify that bootloader is not
modified.

## Partition tables

Usually disks must be partitioned and there are two definitions how to store
partition information.

1. MBR (Master Boot Record) - is the **first sector** of a data storage device
   that has been partitioned. The MBR sector may contain code to locate the
   active partition and invoke its volume boot record.
2. VBR (Volume Boot Record) - is the **first sector** of a data storage device
   that has _not_ been partitioned, or the first sector of an individual
   partition on a data storage device that has been partitioned. It may contain
   code to load an operating system (or other standalone program) installed on
   that device or within that partition.

The maximum capacity of MBR partition tables is only about 2 terabytes.

MBR partition tables can have a maximum of 4 separate partitions, but one of
those partitions can be configured to be an extended partition, which is a
partition that can be split up into an 23 additional partitions. In total MBR
can have 23 + 3 = 26 partitions.

To boot from an MBR disk, the boot mode should be Legacy BIOS instead of UEFI
and the boot mode is UEFI.

GPT partition tables offer a maximum capacity of 9.7 zetabytes. 1 zetabyte is
about 1 billion terabytes.

GPT partition tables allow for up to 128 separate partitions.

I use GUIDs in my `fstab`, so I can easily identify partitions.

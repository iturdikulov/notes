# How to study or learn

TODO: flashcards are not ideal, need to review

> Education is a **purposeful activity** directed at **achieving certain aims**, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty.

Place for study is important. You can prepare ==environment== for study, reduce distraction factors. For example, if you make your bed, you will not want to sleep there, because it's accurate, and you want keep it accurate, it can be also initial ritual to make first task done!. Sometimes you can find other places to study, for example study cafe.

If you spend more time on learning, you will be more effective. To increase effective try to understand, you're learning ==fact or concept==. Name of thing it's fact, what it does concept.

==Concepts== are more important than facts. Learning only facts it's waste of time. Try to understand the essence of thing and facts about it. <!--SR:!2024-08-04,1,210-->

To test yourself try to put the concept in ==your own words==. If you can't do it, you probably really don't understand it, and you need spent time to make it meaningful for you. Otherwise, you just study ineffectively, and wasting your study time.

What is ==meaningful==? It's something which can be related to something you already know. For example, you know about filesystem, like NTFS, FAT, etc. And you just discovered and learn new one Btrfs. You associate it with previous, compare it, find pros and cons and then add it as new thing into your knowledge system (let's assume its work in that way and leave details).

To simplify learning, break concepts and facts into ==small chunks== and reinforce them. Find out fun things to do during short breaks and great rewards after finishing studying.

## Advice to study

1. Study with social groups increase your ==motivation== and help you to learn. It's also provided challenge and competition.
2. Read the ==whole chunk of material== and then get back and read and understand the 1st paragraph again, one by one.
3. Sleep well, have a good rest for your memory, your brain do sort of ==garbage cleaning (toxin removing)== during the sleep.
4. Write ==notes== during the reading, and right after the reading; sit down with your notes and expand on everything you wrote down, dive into it deeply. If you want to do it after 2 hours you will have forgotten some of your own notes.
5. Look for classmates and ask them for ==help or help== them.
6. Active Recitation: The best way to learn is to ==teach somebody== else. If there's no one, teach an empty chair, teach virtual public, record video, or write it out.
7. How to use textbooks? Use "==[[SQ3R_method]]==": Survey, Question, Read, Recall, Repetition.
8. ==Acronyms== and interacting images can help you remember and memorize facts, terms, and idioms.
9. Use ==[[spaced_repetition]] and [[Zettelkasten]] method.

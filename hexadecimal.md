# Hexadecimal

> In [[mathematics]] and [[computing]], the hexadecimal
> (also base-16 or simply hex) [[number|numeral]] system is a positional numeral
> system that represents numbers using a radix (base) of sixteen. Unlike the
> decimal system representing numbers using ten symbols, hexadecimal uses
> sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols "0"–"9" to represent values 0
> to 9, and "A"–"F" (or alternatively "a"–"f") to represent values from ten to
> fifteen.\

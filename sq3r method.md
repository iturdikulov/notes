# SQ3R

This is sort of [@SQ3R2022] optimization of the reading process.

## How I use it

- 1-2 initialization, skim material and write questions
- 3-4 read/write answers
- 5 repeating, what I wrote, can I explain it

## 1. Survey - reading, bold terms

Skim material, quickly check key terms, bold/italic items, headings, images,
tables, etc.

## 2. Question - practice questions, read with purpose

Find chapter/article questions if existed, or try to find them yourself (maybe
in summary, or in the end of the chapter).

## 3. Read/Rephrase - teach it to someone who doesn’t know

After you read the chapter, try to answer the questions you found in the
previous step. So you explain things to "virtual" person or actually to someone
else. Or to pet?

## 4. Recall - active recall - flashcards

Write flashcards/notes in your own words, this give you a chance to see what you
really know and what you don't know. And later you can use them to test
yourself. This process is linked with Read/Rephrase.

## 5. Repetition - spaced repetition

Use flashcards to test yourself, and repeat the process.

## General tips

- Repetition over time
- Get main idea first
- Implement solution yourself
- Make flash cards
- Review flash cards when you have time
- Progress is more important than perfection

## Notes

I generally use daily, weekly and yearly notes.

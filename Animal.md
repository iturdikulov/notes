# Animal

> Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom
> Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe
> oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow
> from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development.\

In my [[In_real_life_IRL|life]] I had some pets, cats and 1 dog. I like animals,

Here I store various information about animals.

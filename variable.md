# Variable (computer science)

> In [[computer_programming]], a variable is an abstract
> ==storage location== paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains
> some known or unknown quantity of data or object referred to as a value; or in
> simpler terms, a variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or
> type of data (like integer, float, string etc...). A variable can eventually
> be associated with or identified by a memory address. The variable name is the
> usual way to reference the stored value, in addition to referring to the
> variable itself, depending on the context. This separation of name and content
> allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it
> represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value
> during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the
> course of program execution.\

Variables store [[value|values]] used during [[computation]].

# 12. What Now?

This tutorial is part of Python’s documentation set. Some other documents in the set are:

- [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html):
You should browse through this manual, which gives complete (though terse)
reference material about types, functions, and the modules in the standard
library. The standard Python distribution includes a *lot* of additional code.
There are modules to read Unix mailboxes, retrieve documents via HTTP, generate
random numbers, parse command-line options, compress data, and many other tasks.
Skimming through the Library Reference will give you an idea of what’s
available.

- [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html)
explains how to install additional modules written by other Python users.

- [The Python Language
Reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html): A detailed
explanation of Python’s syntax and semantics. It’s heavy reading, but is useful
as a complete guide to the language itself.


More Python resources:

- [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org): The major Python web site.
It contains code, documentation, and pointers to Python-related pages around the
web.
- [https://docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org): Fast access to Python’s
documentation.
- [https://pypi.org](https://pypi.org): The Python Package Index, previously
also nicknamed the Cheese Shop, is an index of user-created Python modules that
are available for download. Once you begin releasing code, you can register it
here so that others can find it. “Cheese Shop” is a Monty Python’s sketch: a
customer enters a cheese shop, but whatever cheese he asks for, the clerk says
it’s missing.
- [https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/](https://code.activestate.com/recipes/langs/python/):
The Python Cookbook is a sizable collection of code examples, larger modules,
and useful scripts. Particularly notable contributions are collected in a book
also titled Python Cookbook (O’Reilly & Associates, ISBN 0-596-00797-3.)
- [https://pyvideo.org](https://pyvideo.org) collects links to Python-related
videos from conferences and user-group meetings.
- [https://scipy.org](https://scipy.org): The Scientific Python project includes
modules for fast array computations and manipulations plus a host of packages
for such things as linear algebra, Fourier transforms, non-linear solvers,
random number distributions, statistical analysis and the like.

For Python-related questions and problem reports, you can post to the newsgroup
*comp.lang.python*, or send them to the mailing list at
[python-list@python.org](mailto:python-list%40python.org). The newsgroup and
mailing list are gatewayed, so messages posted to one will automatically be
forwarded to the other. There are hundreds of postings a day, asking (and
answering) questions, suggesting new features, and announcing new modules.
Mailing list archives are available at
[https://mail.python.org/pipermail/](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/).

Before posting, be sure to check the list of [Frequently Asked
Questions](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/index.html#faq-index) (also called the
FAQ). The FAQ answers many of the questions that come up again and again, and
may already contain the solution for your problem.

> Relaxation is a form of mild ecstasy coming from the frontal lobe of the brain
> in which the backward cortex sends signals to the frontal cortex via a mild
> sedative. Relaxation can be achieved through meditation, autogenics, breathing
> exercises, progressive muscle relaxation and other means.\

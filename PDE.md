# PDE (Personalized Development Environment)

I originally heard this term from [[TJDeVries]] in his video:
[PDE: A different take on editing code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg).

PDE's must support basics coding features (syntax highlighting, code folding,
and indentation, etc.), be configurable, scriptable and extensible, fun and
enjoyment in Development.

For me [[Neovim]] perfectly fits with all PDE requirements.

## To-do

- [ ] Watch [PDE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMVIJhC9Veg) again.

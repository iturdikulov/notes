# Fun With A Pencil: How Everybody Can Easily Learn to Draw

Andrew Loomis (1892-1959) is revered amongst artists - including comics
superstar Alex Ross - for his mastery of drawing. His first book, Fun With a
Pencil, published in 1939 is a wonderfully crafted and engaging introduction to
drawing, cartooning, and capturing the essence of a subject all while having
fun. With delightful step-by-step instruction from Professor Blook, Loomis's
charming alter ego on the page.

# Reference

> A reference is a relationship between objects in which one object designates,
> or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The
> first object in this relation is said to refer to the second object. It is
> called a name for the second object. The next object, the one to which the
> first object refers, is called the referent of the first object. A name is
> usually a phrase or expression, or some other symbolic representation. Its
> referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity,
> or an abstract concept.\
>
> In [[computer_science]], references are data types that refer to an object
> elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of data
> structures, such as linked lists. Generally, a reference is a value that
> enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most
> [[programming_language]] support some form of reference.
>
> The notion of reference is also important in relational database theory; see
> referential integrity.\

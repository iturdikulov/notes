# Reference

> A reference is a relationship between objects in which one object designates,
> or acts as a means by which to connect to or link to, another object. The
> first object in this relation is said to refer to the second object. It is
> called a name for the second object. The next object, the one to which the
> first object refers, is called the referent of the first object. A name is
> usually a phrase or expression, or some other symbolic representation. Its
> referent may be anything – a material object, a person, an event, an activity,
> or an abstract concept.\
>
> In [[computer_science|computer science]], references are data types that refer
> to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of
> data structures, such as linked lists. Generally, a reference is a value that
> enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most
> [[programming_language|programming languages]] support some form of reference.
>
> The notion of reference is also important in relational database theory; see
> referential integrity.\

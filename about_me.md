# About me
TODO: very scratchy

Programmer, problem-solver, self-learner, self-promoter, self-organizer;
Human being, who wants to be happy, healthy, kind, and wise;
Family member, who wants to be a good son and brother.

I would self-identify as a fan of “procedural programming.”
I worked as a Frontend developer for a few years (actually 7)
I worked as a Python developer for a few years (actually 3)
I have done a fair amount of Linux specific tasks in my free time.
I run Linux Distribution on my personal computer. I use pacman/pikaur as my package manager.
I like Linux the way that some people like Linux, and care about how computers
works at a low level.
I like high-level abstractions and simplicity and building things.
I know some things about computers, how they work on low-level.

My current interests available in [[index]] note.

## IRL

[[style_of_life|My style of life]] currently still chaotic, but I'm trying to
organize it. These notes are help me to do it.

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages and [[IRL]]. I
also store my [[how_do_I_work_with_contacts|contacts]] workflow.

Mentoring, I'm trying to help colleagues, people on [[GitHub]] projects,
[[Stack_Overflow|Stack Overflow]], etc.

# Secure Shell (SSH)

> The Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a
> [[cryptographic_protocol|cryptographic network protocol]] for operating
> network services securely over an unsecured network. Its most notable
> applications are remote login and command-line execution.
>
> SSH applications are based on a **client–server architecture**,
> connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server. SSH operates as a
> layered protocol suite comprising three principal hierarchical
> components: the transport layer provides server authentication,
> confidentiality, and integrity; the user authentication protocol
> validates the user to the server; and the connection protocol multiplexes
> the encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels.\

# Anxiety

> Anxiety is an [[emotion]] which is characterized by an unpleasant state of
> inner turmoil and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events. Anxiety
> is different than fear in that the former is defined as the anticipation of a
> future threat whereas the latter is defined as the emotional response to a
> real threat. It is often accompanied by nervous behavior such as pacing back
> and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.\

> misfortune. Very often, people with anxiety also feel worries. There can also
> be physical symptoms, like having a headache or an upset stomach.\

## How I fight against anxiety

- Things which I can't solve, ==I don't worry about them==.
- Things which I can solve, but it's require too much time and confirmation, I
  can worry about them, but ==I need sort of "green light" to start solving them==.
- I'm reducing my troubles by solving things which ==I can solve==.
- Calendar and deadlines can reduce my troubles by ==reminding== me of things
  which I can solve. If I can't do something, I inform someone if it's required
  or would be nice.

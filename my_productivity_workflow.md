## Organize

I organize my work using, [[GTD]] mainly using Inbox, Tasks (TODO and NEXT),
Daily and Weekly notes with [[Taskwarrior]].

To follow external timelines I sometimes use [[calendar]] events, but it's
secondary task planner.

To connect with colleagues I use [[IM]] and [[email]] clients.

In my work significantly help my [[development_environment]], [[backup]]
plan and daily [[maintenance]], with attention to [[computer_security]]
practices.

Currently, I'm working now as a full-stack software engineer in a small company
(remote, full-stack position, but moving into [[backend]]
position).

I also use various [[my_awesome_software_list|software]].

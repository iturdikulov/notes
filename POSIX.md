# POSIX

> The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX; IPA: /ˈpɒz.ɪks/) is a family
> of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining
> compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines both the system and
> user-level application programming interfaces (APIs), along with command line
> shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with
> variants of [[Unix]] and other operating systems. POSIX is also a trademark of
> the IEEE. POSIX is intended to be used by both application and system
> developers.\

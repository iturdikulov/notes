# Signed number representations

> Used to solve the problem of representing negative integers in binary. The
> problem of trying to store the negative sign (−) of a binary [[number]] is
> that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative
> assignment. It is not possible to just use 'off' for minus and 'on' for plus
> because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a
> sign.\

To solve this issue computer designers invented two's method for storing
negative binary numbers.

TODO: Describe two's method

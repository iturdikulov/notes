# How to study?

Place for study is important. You can prepare ==environment== for study, reduce
distraction factors. For example if you make your bed, you will not want to
sleep there, because it's accurate, and you wank keep it accurate. Sometimes you
can find other places to study, for example study café.

If you spend more time on learning, you will be more effective. To increase
effective try to understand, you're learning ==fact or concept==. Name of thing
it's fact, what it does concept.

==Concepts== are more important than facts. Learning only facts it's waste of
time. Try to understand the essence of thing and facts about it.

To test yourself try to put the concept in ==your own words==. If you can't do
it, you probably really don't understand it, and you need spent time to make it
meaningful for you. Otherwise, you just study ineffectively, and wasting your
study time.

What is ==meaningful==? It's something which can be related to something you
already know. For example, you know about file systems, like NTFS, FAT, etc. And
you just discovered and learn new one BTRFS. You associate it with previous,
compare it, find pros and cons and then add it as new thing into your knowledge
system (let's assume its work in that way and leave details).

To simplify learning, break concepts and facts into ==small chunks== and
reinforce them. Find out fun things to do during short breaks and great rewards
after finishing studying.

## Advices

1. Study with social groups increase your ==motivation== and help you to learn.
   It's also provided challenge and competition.

1. Read the ==whole chunk of material== and then get back and read and
   understand the 1st paragraph again, one by one.
1. Sleep well, have a good rest for your memory, your brain do
   ==sort of garbage== cleaning during the sleep.
4. Write ==notes== during the reading, and right after the reading; sit down
   with your notes and expand on everything you wrote down, dive into it deeply.
   If you want to do it after 2 hours you will have forgotten some of your own
   notes.
5. Look for classmates and ask them for ==help or help== them.
6. Active Recitation: The best way to learn is to ==teach somebody== else. If
   there's no one, teach an empty chair, teach virtual public, record video, or
   write it out.
7. How to use textbooks? Use "==[[Sq3R_method]]==": Survey, Question,
   Read, Recall, Repetition.
8. ==Acronyms== and interacting images can help you remember and memorize facts,
   terms, and idioms.
9. Use ==[[Spaced_repetition]]==, research software like [[Zotero_(software)]] and
   [[Zettelkasten]] method.

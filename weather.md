# Weather

> The state of the atmosphere, describing for example the degree to which it is
> hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy. On Earth, most
> weather phenomena occur in the lowest layer of the planet's atmosphere, the
> troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers to day-to-day
> temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions, whereas climate
> is the term for the averaging of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of
> time. When used without qualification, "weather" is generally understood to
> mean the weather of Earth.
>
> There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are
> important forecasts because they are used to protect
> [[in real life (irl)|life]] and property. Forecasts based on
> temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to
> commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by
> utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.

# Programming style (code style)

> Set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a
> [[computer_program|computer program]]. It is often claimed that following a
> particular programming style will help
> [[Programmer|programmers]] read and understand
> [[Source_code|source_code]] conforming to the style, and help to avoid
> introducing errors.

> , written in the 1970s, and illustrated with examples from the FORTRAN and
> PL/I languages prevalent at the time.\

My first experience with code style was while I learned basics of web
development and I mainly checked [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).

The elements of programming style are next what I will read.
TODO: check in the future, did I read it?

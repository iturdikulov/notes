# Computer performance

> In [[computing]], computer performance is the amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system. Outside of specific contexts, computer performance is estimated in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and speed of executing [[computer_program]] instructions. When it comes to high computer performance, one, or more of the following factors might be involved:
>
> - Short response time for a given piece of work.
> - High throughput (rate of processing work).
> - Low utilization of computing resource(s).
> - Fast (or highly compact) data compression and decompression.
> - High availability of the computing system or application.
> - High bandwidth.
> - Short data transmission time.\

# 3D computer graphics

> 3D [[computer_graphics|computer graphics]], sometimes called CGI, 3D-CGI or
> three-dimensional computer graphics are graphics that use a three-dimensional
> representation of geometric data (often Cartesian) that is stored in the
> computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering digital
> images, usually 2D images but sometimes 3D images. The resulting images may be
> stored for viewing later (possibly as an animation) or displayed in real
> time.\

I'm trying to [[CG_learning_path|learn]] 3D computer graphics.

# High-level programming language

From Wikipedia [@HighlevelProgrammingLanguage2023]:

> In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming
> language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer.

So high-level language hide some low-level details and provide more high-level
abstractions. Which can make programming easier to write code.

So simplify can be used natural language elements, automating significant tasks
(like memory management), this is abstraction elements. Amount of abstractions
defines how "high-level" a programming language is.

First high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse in
1942, but it was not implemented in his time (but has influence to others).

So the first significantly widespread high-level programming language was
Fortran, created in 1950s.

Instead, dealing with registers, memory addresses and call stacks
([[low-level programming language]]), high-level languages deals
with:

- variables
- arrays
- objects
- complex arithmetic or boolean expressions
- subroutines and functions
- loops
- threads
- locks
- other abstractions

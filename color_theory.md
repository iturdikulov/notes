# Color theory

> In the [[Visual_arts|visual arts]], color theory is the body of practical
> guidance for color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color
> combination. Color terminology based on the **color wheel** and its geometry
> separates colors into primary color, secondary color, and tertiary color.
>
> The understanding of color theory dates to antiquity. Aristotle (d. 322 BCE)
> and Claudius Ptolemy (d. 168 CE) already discussed which and how colors can be
> produced by mixing other colors. The influence of light on color was
> investigated and revealed further by al-Kindi (d. 873) and Ibn al-Haytham
> (d.1039). Ibn Sina (d. 1037), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1274), and Robert
> Grosseteste (d. 1253) discovered that contrary to the teachings of Aristotle,
> there are multiple color paths to get from black to white.
>
> More modern approaches to color theory principles can be found in the writings
> of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c.
> 1490). A formalization of "color theory" began in the 18th century, initially
> within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton's theory of color (Opticks,
> 1704) and the nature of primary colors. From there it developed as an
> independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry
> and vision science.\

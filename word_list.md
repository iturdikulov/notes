# Word list

> A word list (or lexicon) is a list of a language's lexicon (generally sorted
> by frequency of occurrence either by levels or as a ranked list) within some
> given text corpus, serving the purpose of vocabulary acquisition. A lexicon
> sorted by frequency "provides a rational basis for making sure that learners
> get the best return for their vocabulary learning effort" (Nation 1997), but
> is mainly intended for course writers, not directly for learners. Frequency
> lists are also made for lexicographical purposes, serving as a sort of
> checklist to ensure that common words are not left out. Some major pitfalls
> are the corpus content, the corpus register, and the definition of "word".
> While word counting is a thousand years old, with still gigantic analysis done
> by hand in the mid-20th century, natural language electronic processing of
> large corpora such as movie subtitles (SUBTLEX megastudy) has accelerated the
> research field.\

I store various word lists in text files, for experiments with chats, neural
networks, [[diceware]], tests,

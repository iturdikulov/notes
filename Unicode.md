# Unicode

> Unicode, formally The Unicode Standard, is a text encoding standard maintained
> by the Unicode Consortium designed to support the use of text written in all
> of the world's major writing systems. Version 15.1 of the standard defines
> 149813 characters and 161 scripts used in various ordinary, literary,
> academic, and technical contexts. Many common characters, including numerals,
> punctuation, and other symbols, are unified within the standard and are not
> treated as specific to any given writing system. Unicode encodes thousands of
> emoji, with the continued development thereof conducted by the Consortium as a
> part of the standard. Moreover, the widespread adoption of Unicode was in
> large part responsible for the initial popularization of emoji outside of
> Japan. Unicode is ultimately capable of encoding more than 1.1 million
> character.\

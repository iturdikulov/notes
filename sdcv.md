## Ordering dictionaries

For example, you can run:

```
$ sdcv -l
Dictionary's name   Word count
oxford    43808
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate    119769
```

you take the first column of output, in other words Dictionary's name,
and put it to ~/.sdcv_ordering line by line:

```sh
# optimal dictionary ordering: Apersyan, Lingvo Universal, Motitsky, Babylon,
# etc
$ cat ~/.sdcv_ordering
Merriam-Webster's Collegiate
oxford
$
```

that's all, at the next run of sdcv, for example sdcv man you get at first
translation from Merriam-Webster's Collegiate and after that from oxford
dictionary and after that all other translations.

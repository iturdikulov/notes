# Kiwix

> Kiwix is a free and open-source offline web browser created by Emmanuel
> Engelhart and Renaud Gaudin in 2007. It was first launched to allow offline
> access to Wikipedia, but has since expanded to include other projects from the
> Wikimedia Foundation, public domain texts from Project Gutenberg, many of the
> Stack Exchange sites, and many other resources.

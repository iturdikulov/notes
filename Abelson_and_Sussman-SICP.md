# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

> Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs has had a dramatic impact on
> [[computer_science]] curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited
> revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations
> of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the
> [[Interpreter|interpreters]] and [[compiler|compilers]], and the authors have
> incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the
> course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been
> introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to
> dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent
> programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic
> programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in
> graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming,
> and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to
> run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.\

# Light (visible light)

> Electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye. Visible
> light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400–700
> nanometres (nm), corresponding to frequencies of 750–420 terahertz, between
> the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter
> wavelengths).
>
> In [[physics]], the term "light" may refer more broadly to electromagnetic
> radiation of any wavelength, whether visible or not. In this sense, gamma
> rays, X-rays, microwaves and radio waves are also light. The primary
> properties of light are intensity, propagation direction, frequency or
> wavelength spectrum and polarization. Its speed in vacuum, $299792458\text{
> m/s}$, is one of the fundamental constants of nature. Like all types of
> electromagnetic radiation, visible light propagates by massless
> [[elementary_particle|elementary particles]] called photons that represents
> the quanta of electromagnetic field, and can be analyzed as both waves and
> particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area
> in modern physics.\

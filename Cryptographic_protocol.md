# Cryptographic protocol

> A cryptographic protocol is an abstract or concrete protocol that
> performs a [[Computer_security|security]]-related function and applies
> [[Cryptography|cryptographic]] methods, often as sequences of
> cryptographic primitives. A protocol describes how the
> [[Algorithm|algorithms]] should be used and includes details about data
> structures and representations, at which point it can be used to
> implement multiple, interoperable versions of a program.
>
> Cryptographic protocols are widely used for secure application-level data
> transport. A cryptographic protocol usually incorporates at least some of
> these aspects:
>
> - Key agreement or establishment
> - Entity authentication
> - Symmetric encryption and message authentication material construction
> - Secured application-level data transport
> - Non-repudiation methods
> - Secret sharing methods
> - Secure multi-party computation\

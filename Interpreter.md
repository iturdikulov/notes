# Interpreter (computing)

What is an interpreter in computer science?
<br class="f">
In [[computer_science]], an interpreter is a [[computer_program]] that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been [[compiler|compiled]] into a machine language program.

What are the general strategies for program execution used by interpreters?
<br class="f">
- Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
- Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation or object code and immediately execute that;
- Explicitly execute stored pre-compiled [[bytecode]] made by a compiler and matched with the interpreter Virtual Machine. <!--SR:!2025-08-02,2,202-->

Here example how [[Python]] interpreter works:

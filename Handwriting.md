# Handwriting

> Handwriting is the writing done with a **writing instrument**, such as a pen
> or pencil, in the hand. Handwriting includes both printing and cursive styles
> and is separate from formal calligraphy or typeface. Because each person's
> handwriting is unique and different, it can be used to verify a document's
> writer. The deterioration of a person's handwriting is also a symptom or
> result of several different diseases. The inability to produce clear and
> coherent handwriting is also known as dysgraphia.\

I like to write beautiful and readable handwriting, but I prefer calligraphy
style.

TODO: add my own font!

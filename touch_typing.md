# Touch typing

> Touch typing (also called blind typing, or touch keyboarding) is a style of
> typing.
>
> Although the phrase refers to typing without using the sense of sight to find
> the keys—specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard
> through muscle memory.
>
> The term is often used to refer to a specific form of touch typing that
> involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the
> keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for specific other keys. (Under
> this usage, typists who do not look at the keyboard but do not use home row
> either are referred to as hybrid typists.) Both two-handed touch typing and
> one-handed touch typing are possible.\

WPM - words per minute, CPM - characters per minute. WPM calculation:
$$wpm = cpm / 5$$

## Training

- My custom `typing` script. Which is just a wrapper around `tt` from
  [lemnos/tt: A terminal based typing test.](https://github.com/lemnos/tt) I'm
  trying to combine words learning with touch typing.

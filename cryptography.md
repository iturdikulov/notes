# Cryptography

> Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós
> "hidden, secret"; and γράφειν graphein, "to write", or -λογία -logia, "study",
> respectively), is the practice and study of techniques for secure
> communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally,
> cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third
> parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography
> exists at the intersection of the disciplines of [[mathematics]],
> [[computer_science]], information security (also [[computer_security]]),
> electrical engineering, digital signal processing, [[physics]], and others.\

# dotfiles - Hidden file and hidden directory

Hidden file or directory, is item which file system utilities do not display by
default when they are used to showing directory listing. This behavior useful to
not "clutter" the display of the content of directory.

They are commonly used for storing user configuration files.

My personal `dotfiles` [GitHub](https://github.com/iturdikulov/dotfiles)
contains almost everything related to software which I use.

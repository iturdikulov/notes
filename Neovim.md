# Neovim (text editor)

> Neovim is based on Vim by Bram Moolenaar.
>
> Neovim is emphatically a fork of Vim, not a clone: compatibility with Vim
> (especially editor and Vimscript features) is maintained where possible.\
> — <cite>`:help nvim`</cite>

Hyperextensible Vim-based text editor. My [[PDE]] (personal Editor Development
Environment).

## What I handle by Neovim

- Code editing
- Code version control with git and plugins
- Projects running and debugging with plugins
- Database management system with plugins
- Video notes with timestamps using MPV's IPC integration

## Command line

Enable logs - `nvim -V10nvim.log`.

To start with different config use ==`$NVIM_APPNAME`== env variable. For
example, setting it to "neovim" before running Neovim will result in Neovim
looking for configuration files in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/neovim` instead of
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`.

## Useful commands

Hide line numbers::`:set nonu nornu` or `:set nonumber norelativenumber`.
Get variable value - `:set nonu?`.

`:h vimtutor` is quick getting started guide, same command aviable in CLI.

## Basics

Neovim like Vim has two main modes (and some additional), insert mode and command mode.

Quit and ignore changes in ALL files (be careful with this, `:q` is much safer)::Press `Esc` and type `:qa!`

Up, Down, Left, Right
&#10;<br>
`k`,`j`,`h`,`l`, but prefer other navigation keys. These keys have one important
advantage, they are not generated escape codes unlike arrows keys, and since
only one method to detect escape code is calculating delays (user can enter
escape sequence much slower), it can sometimes help on slow connections.

Normal mode, for navigation and manipulation of text::`ESC` or `C-[` or `C-c`

Insert mode, for inserting new text.
&#10;<br>
`iIaAoO`, `i` start input before the current symbol (insert or prepend), `a` ...
after current symbol (append).

Visual, for navigation and manipulation of text selections::`v` or `V` or `C-v`
<!--SR:!2023-06-06,2,228-->

Command-line mode, for entering editor commands (Ex commands)::`:`

Replace mode, replace existing text by directly typing over it::`R`

Mode similar to visual, but with a more MS Windows-like behavior::select mode, `gh`, `gH`

Similar to the command-line mode but optimized for batch processing::ex-mode, `gQ`

Select something::`v[motion]`

Copy something::`y[register][num][motion]`

Copy something into system clipboard::`"<SPC>y[motion]`, I have own mapping - `<leader>y`

Delete something (can be used with black hole register)::`d[register][num][motion]`

Change something (can be used with black hole register)::`c[register][num][motion]`

`:`::command mode

How to split line
&#10;<br>
Use (a/i/r) keys:
- `i<cr><esc>`
- `a<cr><esc>`
- `r<cr>`

## Search & replace

Grep content in current project and open find toolbar (custom)::`<leader>fs`, TODO: remap

`/`::search mode

`?`::backward search mode

`//`::repeat last search

`/search\c`::case-insensitive search

`/search\C`::case-sensitive search

`fx|Fx`::search in current line forward for 'x', backward for 'x'

`tx|Tx`::search in current line forward before 'x', backward before 'x'

`,`, `;`
&#10;<br>
Backward, forward after that "finds", works for `s`, `f` and `t`.

`n|N`::repeat search in same direction and opposite direction, support multiline search.

`/ ESC`::clear search highlights or `:noh`

`set ignorecase` or `set ic`::Enable ignore case in search patterns

`set smartcase` or `set scs`::Case-insensitive search, unless there is a capital letter in the search, but `ignorecase` needs to be on

`:grep {pattern} {file} ...`::Search pattern across files pattern.

`:vim[grep][!] /{pattern}/[g][j][f] {file} ...`::Search pattern across files pattern.

`:copen`::Open quickfix window, but better to use Trouble.nvim (`<leader>xx`)

`C-k`::`:cnext`, next file from quickfix

`C-j`::`:cprev`, previous file from quickfix

`@:`::repeat last command

`@@`::repeat last `@<whatever>`

Find each occurrence of 'foo' (in all lines), and replace it with 'bar'
&#10;<br>
`:%s/foo/bar/g[c]`
`%` - all lines.
`s` - substitute.
`g` - global (all occurrences in the line not only the first one).
`[c]` - enable confirmations.

The replacement will check each line in the buffer, but will only match within
the last visual selection
&#10;<br>
Same as find each occurrence, but need to add `%V` suffix to the search pattern.
`:%s/\%Vfoo/bar/g[c]`
`[c]` - confirmations.

`:'<,'>s/old/new/g`::replace all old with new throughout visual selection

`&`::repeat last substitute, equal to `:s//~/`

`:s/\[foo\]//g`::Escape the square brackets with a backslash, to replace `[foo]`

`:s/pat\/tern/replace/g`::Escape the `/` to match `pat/tern`

`:s#pat/tern#replace#g`::Use another character as separator to match "pat/tern".

Replace single quotes to double::`:s/\'\(.*\)\'/\"\1\"`

`:%s/\(^ *\)\@<! \/ /g`
&#10;<br>
Replace multiple spaces with one, This says find 2 or more spaces (` \`)
that are NOT preceded by 'the start of the line followed by zero or more
spaces'.

`*|#` or `g*|g#`::search forward word under cursor, search backward word under cursor

### Search and replace tips

How to do granular find and replace something in the whole file (3 steps)?
&#10;<br>
1. Search something with `/`
2. Type `cgn` and `word` to replace, or run some command, where `gn` is a
   motion that selects the next match of the last used search pattern. Of course,
   you can use `cgN` and `dgn` to delete, etc.
3. Find next `n/N` and repeat `.`

<!-- WARNING: this is very useful -->
Find and Replace in Multiple Files using `argslist`
&#10;<br>
1. Initialize the `argslist` with `:args *.ext` from CWD.
2. Optionally add more files with `:argadd *.ext`. You can also use `**/*.ext`
   to search recursively.
3. Optionally remove some files with `:argdelete *.ext`, to delete all use `*`
4. Do search and replace: `:argdo %s/foo/bar/[g][e][c] | update`. `e` here
   prevents error messages when there is no match, `c` is for confirmation.
\
You can also use `:bufdo` to do the same thing in all open buffers.
To use `argslist` in `vimgrep` use `:vimgrep // ##`. `//` is last search
pattern. Use `:cdo` to do something with the quickfix list.

<!-- WARNING: this is very useful -->
Search with telescope and quickfix
&#10;<br>
1. `<leader>fs` to grep results
2. `<C-q>` to add all results to the quickfix list
3. `:cdo s/StringOne/StringTwo/g | update` to make the change and save all the files.

## Files

Switch to normal mode in terminal
&#10;<br>
By default, `<C-\><C-n>`, but I have custom keybinding `<Esc><Esc>`

Quick switch to terminal and back workflow
&#10;<br>
Ctrl-Z while editing in vim to send it to background, do your thing on the
terminal and use `fg` command at any time to bring up vim again.

Switch to previous file, the best alternative
&#10;<br>
`c-^`

`:e [filename]` or `:edit [filename]`
&#10;<br>
Edit file, support `tab` completion. Can be used instead touch and edit files.

Edit the file whose name is under or after the cursor::`gf`

## Vim registers

What is vim register?
&#10;<br>
It's sort of space in memory to store text. Every register can be accessed using
double quote `"`. For example `r` register, copy/paste will be like this `"ry` /
`"rp`. You can access register in insert/command mode by `C-r[register name]`.
You can use the `:reg[a|b|c]` command to see all the registers and their
content. If you use `qw` to record a macro, the register `"w` will have all
actions which you have done.

The unnamed register (yank, delete)::`""`, TODO: need review

10 numbered registers (latest yank, newest, ..., oldest)::`"0` to `"9`

The last entered text (read only)::`".`

Current file path (read only)::`"%`

Most recently used command (read only)::`":`

The alternate file register (sort of last edited file)::`"#`

The black hole register::`"_`
<!--SR:!2023-06-06,2,228-->

Register AKA the selection (system clipboard)::`"*`, `"+`
<!--SR:!2023-06-06,2,213-->

Last search pattern register::`"/`

26 Named registers \"a to \"z (or \"A to\"Z), sort of clipboards::`[a-z]`

The small delete register::`"-`

The expression register, useful for calculation::`"=`, `C-r =...`

## Paths and history

Print directory/name of file
&#10;<br>
`:echo @%`

Execute current file::`!%`

Get name of file ('tail')
&#10;<br>
`:echo expand('%:t')`

Get full path of file
`:echo expand('%:p')`

Get directory containing file ('head')
`:echo expand('%:p:h')`

How to paste yanked text into the Vim command line?
&#10;<br>
Hit `<C-r>"`. If you have literal control characters in what you have yanked,
use `<C-r><Ctrl-o>"`.

How to paste system clipboard into the Vim command line?
&#10;<br>
I use `C-S-v`, it's working in my terminal. Or use `<C-r>+`.

How to open terminal in vertical split?
&#10;<br>
`:vsplit term://zsh` to run Z-shell

How do you search through Vim's command history?
&#10;<br>
I use telescope commands history (`<leader>fc`).
You can also use `q:` or `q/` in normal mode and then press `/`.
Press `C-f` in command mode to open the command history window.
For more about the command history window, see `:h cmdwin`.

How quickly close command history window?
&#10;<br>
`<C-c>[<C-c>]`

## Windows

You can use vim motion keys to navigate between open windows, for example to
navigate to left window?
&#10;<br>
`C-w h`
So moving between windows can be done with `C-w` followed by `h/j/k/l` for
left/down/up/right navigation respectively.

## [dispatch.vim: Asynchronous build and test dispatcher](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dispatch)

`cc`::go to next error?

Dispatch.vim's :make wrapper :Make, seems initial abstraction.

:Make - if you're in tmux, a small split will be opened at the bottom.

When the task completes, the window closes, the errors are loaded and parsed,
and the quickfix window automatically opens. At no point will your focus be
stolen.

Use :Make! for background tasks, window opening in the background.

You can open background results in a split window with `:Copen`.

`:Dispatch` is a wrapper around `:make` and `:compiler`, plus it do some
additional work.

`:Dispatch pytest test/models/user_test.py`

`:Dispatch cd frontend && npm run build`

`:Dispatch python tools/generate-docs.py`

Default dispatch. With no arguments, :Dispatch looks for a b:dispatch variable.
You can set it interactively, or in an autocommand:
`autocmd FileType java let b:dispatch = 'javac %'`
If no b:dispatch is found, it falls back to :Make.

Check dispatch maps with `:h dispatch-maps`, or search them in keymaps
(which-key).

Use `:Focus` to o temporarily, globally override the default dispatch:
`:Focus pytest tests`, use `:Focus!` to reset back to the default.

`:Start` and `:Start!` just run process without parsing/capture output, focus
will be switched.

`:Start ping example.com`

## Vim/NeoVim swapfile

Sometimes vim swap-file (temprorary file buffer) can save you from a data
loosing. But it's usage a little-bi counterintuitive. So here is simple workflow
/ test case:
- Open in NeoVim some file, for example - `/tmp/random`.
- Type someting and save it - `arst :w`.
- Force close NeoVim, to emulate a crash - in my case I just kill pane in tmux,
  `kill-pane`, but can be used someting like `pkill -9 nvim`.
- Open NeoVim again, and open the file - `/tmp/random`.
- You will see a warning message, that swap-file is used, I choose `[R]ecover`,
  verify it (contains `arst`) and save `:w`.
- Open `/tmp/random` file again (`:e` to reopen current), and choose `[D]elete`,
  since swapfile is not needed anymore (we restored it in previus step).

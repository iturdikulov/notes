# Career

## Programmer

> [!quote] 
  The programmer must have the ability of a first-class mathematician for
  abstraction and logical thinking, combined with Edison's talent for
  constructing anything from zero and one. He must combine the accuracy of a
  bank clerk with the insight of an intelligence officer, the fantasy of a
  detective novelist with the sober practicality of a businessman. And besides, a programmer should be familiar with corporate interests, have a taste for teamwork, understand the purpose of the work, and much more.\

Main factors and tips to use LeetCode effectively [^1]:
&#10;<br>
- Consistency
- if you're not focusing, it's OK to just stop and come back later (active
  improvement). But don't forget about consistency.
- [Algorithms](https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) this is your "home
  base". Sort by difficulty, status, etc.
- Start from easiest to hardest. You can start skipping questions if you feel
  like the problems are getting too easy for you.
- Start with problems that have an editorial already written. These are the ones
  with a little "document page" icon in the "Solution" column of the problem
  set.
- Start with problems that have good reviews. I'd initially stay away from
  problems that have a worse than 2:1 ratio of upvotes to downvotes, and
  problems that have 4:1 or above are usually of fairly high quality.
- Eventually, you're going to find a problem that's too hard, and you'll get
  stuck. That's totally fine. In fact, it's absolutely fine (and perhaps even
  efficient) to give up on some problems. It's possible that it requires an
  algorithm or data structure that you haven't seen before, and there's no need
  for you to pull your hair out trying to re-discover an algorithm or data
  structure. Check editorial, discussion and some resources to deeper understand
  this problem, this can help you to unstuck.
- I also strongly recommend "Cracking the Coding Interview". Many of those
  problems are also available on LeetCode (see this list), so you can actually
  use LeetCode as a complementary tool alongside the book. I would consider the
  book to be fairly entry-level, so if you're new to technical interviews, I'd
  recommend starting by going through the book, even before doing LeetCode
  full-time.

# Cloud computing

> Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of [[computer]] system
> resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and [[computing]] power,
> without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have
> functions distributed over multiple locations, each of which is a data center.
> Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and
> typically uses a pay-as-you-go model, which can help in reducing capital
> expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for users.\

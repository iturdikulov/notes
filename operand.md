# Operand

> In computing, an operand is the part of a computer instruction which specifies
> what data is to be ==manipulated or operated on==, while at the same time
> representing the data itself. A computer instruction describes an operation
> such as add or multiply X, while the operand (or operands, as there can be
> more than one) specify on which X to operate as well as the value of X.

> Additionally, in assembly language, an operand is a value (an argument) on
> which the instruction, named by mnemonic, operates. The operand may be a
> processor register, a memory address, a literal constant, or a label. A simple

How you can describe operand purpose in computing?
&#10;
Generally operand is some data on which we do some [[operator|operations]].
Operand can be for example variable, which pointing to some data in memory.

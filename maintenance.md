# Maintenance

> Functional checks, servicing, repairing or replacing of necessary devices,
> equipment, machinery, building infrastructure, and supporting utilities in
> industrial, business, and residential installations. Over time, this has come
> to include multiple wordings that describe various cost-effective practices to
> keep equipment operational; these activities occur either before or after a
> failure.
>
> Any activity—such as tests, measurements, replacements, adjustments, and
> repairs—intended to retain or restore a functional unit in or to a specified
> state in which the unit can perform its required functions.
>
> All action taken to retain material in a serviceable condition or to restore
> it to serviceability. It includes inspections, testing, servicing,
> classification as to serviceability, repair, rebuilding, and reclamation.
>
> All supply and repair action taken to keep a force in condition to carry out
> its mission.
>
> The routine recurring work required to keep a facility (plant, building,
> structure, ground facility, utility system, or other real property) in such
> condition that it may be continuously used, at its original or designed
> capacity and efficiency for its intended purpose.\

I like term Negentropy, which can describe my maintenance process.

> Negentropy is reverse entropy. It means things becoming more in order. By
> 'order' is meant organization, structure and function: the opposite of
> randomness or chaos. One example of negentropy is a star system such as the
> Solar System. Another example is life.\

I store tasks, which I need to check constantly, in this file. This helps me to
reduce chaos in my life (at least digital), I also collect all my techniques and
tools information in this note.

- Maintenance downloads (remove old files, etc...)
- Maintenance [[my_backup_plan|backups]] (weekly check)

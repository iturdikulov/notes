The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what ==can and cannot
be automated==.

I think knowing computer science help to write effective and scalable
[[Code|code]] (goal of good [[Programmer|programmer]], which I want to be). I
described how I [[Learning|learn]] computer science
[[How_I_learn_computer_science|here]].

Computer science connect theory (computation, automation, information) with real
world practice (software and hardware). In Russian, it's known as Информа́тика.

Computer science closely related to
[[Computer_programming|computer programming]].

In computer science central role plays
==[[Algorithm|algorithms]] and [[Data_structure|data_structures]]==.

## Core concepts in computer science [^1]

The theory of computation helping to create **theoretical models (abstract
models)** of how computers work (==computation==) and understanding the **types
of problems (general classes of problems)** these computers can solve. So it's
about creating abstract computing models and understand which general classes of
problems these models can solve.

Cryptography and computer security fields is needed to study (and practice) how
prevent security vulnerabilities and how to communicate securely (secure data
transmission).

Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of
==images==.

Programming language theory considers different ways to describe computational
processes.
Different programming languages can implement computational processes
in different ways and can be used to solve different classes of problems.

Database theory concerns the management of repositories of ==data==. For
example, you have a bunch of messy data (desktop shortcuts), and you can
organize them in some structures (group, sort, etc.) to manage them more
effectively.

==Human–computer interaction== investigates the interfaces through which humans
and computers interact. There many UI specialists, which usually haven't
developing software skills, but they know how to create effective UI.

Software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind ==developing
software==. And usually software engineers solving problems in real world with
requirements from customers.

There are many areas (complex systems), which investigate the principles and
design in their own area. Main areas are: [[Operating_system|operating
systems]], [[Computer_network|networks]] and embedded systems.

What describes Computer Architecture?
?
[[Computer_architecture|Computer architecture]] describes the construction of
computer components and computer-operated equipment (Input, Output, CPU, RAM).

Goal of Artificial intelligence?
?
[[Artificial_intelligence|Artificial intelligence]] and machine learning aim to
synthesize goal-orientated processes such as problem-solving, decision-making,
environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in humans and animals.
In other words replicate humans and animals processes/behavior.

Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process
**image and video data**, while natural language processing aims to understand
and process **textual and linguistic data**.

The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer
science.

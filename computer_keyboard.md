# Computer keyboard

> Peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter keyboard (I even used it) which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.

Currently, I use KBD75 V2 custom mechanical keyboard, which support [[QMK]] firmware. It's allows me to create custom keyboard layers, macro, my own navigation and symbols layers, and other features.

I use [[Colemak_Mod-DH]] keymap layout (not hardware, I use system layout).

# Space exploration

> Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore
> outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by
> astronomers with telescopes, its [[Physics|physical]] exploration is conducted
> both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space
> exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for
> space science.\

> This stellar schematic traces the trajectories of over 100 exploratory
> instruments to ever slip the surly bonds of lower Earth orbit and successfully
> complete its mission. Newly updated to include the James Webb Space Telescope

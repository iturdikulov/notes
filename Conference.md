# Conference

> A conference is a meeting, often lasting a few days, which is organized on a
> particular subject, or to bring together people who have a common interest.
> Conferences can be used as a form of group decision-making, although
> discussion, not always decisions, is the primary purpose of conferences. The
> term derives from the word confer.\

I prefer technical conferences, which I visit mostly online.

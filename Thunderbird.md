# Mozilla Thunderbird

> Free and open-source [^1] email client that also functions as a personal
> information manager with a calendar and contactbook, as well as an RSS feed
> reader, chat client (IRC/XMPP/Matrix), and news client.\

Since thunderbird support all organizing and email related features, I use it as
all-in-one email client, plus it's open-source and now have mobile clients.

Actual shortcuts and main features aviable in thunderbird documentation [^2].
Modifier keys are the Ctrl-key on Windows and Linux, and the Cmd-key on Mac OS devices. This guide uses Ctrl, and Mac users need to replace it with Cmd whenever it is used to make the shortcut work on their devices.

## The most useful shortcuts

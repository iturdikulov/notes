# Mozilla Thunderbird

> Free and open-source [^1] email client that also functions as a personal information manager with a calendar and contacts book, as well as an RSS feed reader, chat client (IRC/XMPP/Matrix), and news client.\
> — <cite>[Mozilla Thunderbird - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird)</cite>

Since Thunderbird support all organizing and email related features, I use it as all-in-one email client, plus it's open-source and now have mobile clients.

Actual shortcuts and main features available in Thunderbird documentation [^2]. Modifier keys are the `Ctrl`-key on Windows and Linux, and the `Cmd`-key on MacOS devices. This guide uses `Ctrl`, and Mac users need to replace it with `Cmd` whenever it is used to make the shortcut work on their devices.

## The most useful shortcuts

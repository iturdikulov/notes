# Public utility

> A public utility company (usually just utility) is an organization that
> maintains the infrastructure for a public service (often also providing a
> service using that infrastructure). Public utilities are subject to forms of
> public control and regulation ranging from local community-based groups to
> statewide government monopolies.
>
> Many utilities are essential for human [[life]], national defense, or
> commerce, and the risk of public harm with mismanagement is considerably
> greater than with other goods.\

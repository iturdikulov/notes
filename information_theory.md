# Information theory

> Branch of applied [[mathematics]] and electrical engineering.
> Information theory measures the amount of information in data that could have
> more than one value. In its most common use, information theory finds
> [[physics|physical]] and mathematical limits on the amounts of data in data
> compression and data communication. Data compression and data communication
> are statistical, because they guess unknown values. The amount of information
> in data measures how easily it is guessed by a person who does not know its
> value.\

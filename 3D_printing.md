# 3D printing

Construction of a 3D object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model.

I have 3D printer which use fused filament fabrication 3D printing process. models. Fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling (with the trademarked acronym FDM), or filament freeform fabrication, is a 3D printing process that uses a continuous filament of a thermoplastic material.

## Printing from Zip Lock

I can print from zip lock, to avoid plastic hydrate and printing quality degradation over time.

Here is schematic how I print from zip lock.

## Calibration

### Flow rate

3D printer flow rate, or the extrusion multiplier, refers to the slicer setting that determines the amount of plastic to extrude. By default, the flow rate is set to 1.0 or 100% depending on the slicer. When you set the flow rate to 1.1 or 110% you are increasing the flow rate by 10%.

Flow rate influences the quality of the print.

General notes:

Do not place the printer near any heat source or flammable or explosive objects. We suggest placing it in a well-ventilated, cool and dustless environment, stable environment without vibration.

Replacement of filaments of the same kind: follow the normal Retreat - Feed process.

Printing PLA/PTEG - remove top cover if room temperature exceed 30¬∞C. Or use mod? https://www.printables.com/model/491477-creality-k1-vented-lid-riser/comments

Replacement of different filaments: Preheat the nozzle to reach the target temperature of the current filament; then retreat it, replace with the target filament, and preheat the nozzle to the higher filament extrude temperature of the two filaments; feed for 30s until the filament has been completely extruded, and finally set the nozzle temperature to the temperature of current filament nozzle.

## Creality Helper Script

Guide how I used [Creality-Helper-Script](https://github.com/Guilouz/Creality-Helper-Script) to unlock some features.

Links:

- [Install & Update Rooted Firmware](https://guilouz.github.io/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/firmwares/install-and-update-rooted-firmware-ender3/?h=root)
- [Reset Factory Settings - Wiki for Creality Helper Script](https://guilouz.github.io/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/firmwares/reset-factory-settings/)

- [Change Date & Time - Wiki for Creality Helper Script](https://guilouz.github.io/Creality-Helper-Script-Wiki/firmwares/change-date-and-time/)

1. OTA update
2. Get root
3. Factory reset, check/fix datetime
4. Install/update helper script

Helper scripts recommended items from Tombraider2006 [^1]:

1 Moonraker and Ngnix (web-server for slicer and reverse-proxy)

2 Fluid (:4408) or 3 Mainsail (:4409) web UI.

4 Entware repo for embedded devices.

5 Klipper Gcode Shell Command, give many "tune" and analyze features with commands and scripts.

6 Klipper Adaptive Meshing & Purging:

On issuse with purging (`variable_purge_margin` doesn't help), like outline/support overlap, need to disable `adaptive_purge_line` in Web UI. TPU printing: need to tune printing profile and add _ADAPTIVE_PURGE_LINE_OFF in the start code and _ADAPTIVE_PURGE_LINE_ON in the end code.

## Replace filament

1. Pause/stop printing
2. Press retract in console (touch display menu option)
3. Unlock extruder
4. Optionaly remove your bowden tube from extruder, can be helpful when fillament is ended in the process of 3D printing.
5. Pull filament out, while taking out your filament don't forget the keep the tension of filament with your fingers at the end (if you keep it loose like in the video it might tangle
6. press extract to remove filament from extruder

7. cut your new filament in 45 degrees angle, gently without breaking your filament push until the end, you will feel when it goes inside, if it resists it's okay,

8. put bowden tube back if needed and lock extruder
9. start printing

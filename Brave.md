# Brave (web browser)

Free open source browser. Currently (11/24) I stopped to use it.

Key features for me:

- Rich ad blocking (Shield), and it's available for all computing platform which I use.
- Support for extensions.
- [[VA-API]] support on [[Linux]].
- [[web_browser#Development tools|Browser DevTools]] support.
- Built-in browser sync, and it's available for all platforms which I use.

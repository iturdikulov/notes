# Camera

> A camera is an optical instrument that captures [[my_pictures|images]]. Most
> cameras can capture 2D images, while some more advanced models can capture
> [[VR_photography_or_virtual-reality_photography|3D images]]. At a basic level,
> most cameras consist of a sealed box (the camera body), with a small hole (the
> aperture) that allows [[light]] to pass through and capture an image on a
> light-sensitive surface (usually a digital sensor or photographic film).
> Cameras have various mechanisms to control how light falls onto the
> light-sensitive surface, including lenses that focus the light and a shutter
> that determines the amount of time the photosensitive surface is exposed to
> the light.\

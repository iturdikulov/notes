# My notation

This note outlines a system for tagging [[learning]] materials and
[[index#Now|other]] stuff.

Custom notations allowing me for quick assessment of learning materials based
on personal experience and priorities, informing future learning decisions.

- [ ] Scheduled for future.
- [!] Scheduled, but has high priority.
- [/] In progress, currently consuming it.
- [x] Completed, it was good.
- [p] Completed, it was very good or perfect.
- [c] Canceled or completed and not liked.
- [-] Stopped at some point, maybe I'll revisit it later, or I don't interest in
  it right now.

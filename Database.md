# Database

>  In [[Computing|computing]], a database is an organized collection of data
>  (also known as a data store) stored and accessed electronically through the
>  use of a database management system. Small databases can be stored on a file
>  system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud
>  storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical
>  considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and
>  storage, query languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and
>  distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and
>  fault tolerance.\

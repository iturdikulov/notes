Old game, I think first played it somewhere in 2005-2006 with my brother. But I
mostly watched him (as usual). Maybe I used some cheats (`b->marvin->b`).

I want to play it again, but this time in "right way". My initial point is
watching video guide, to understand basic controls:


# Gothic controls

Information taken from
[StrategyWiki](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Gothic/Controls) and this video:\
![Gothic Game Controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpRlGYwSL-8)

`Mod` key: `Ctrl` or hold left mouse button.

I use this remaps (optimized for [[Colemak_Mod-DH|Colemak DH]] layout):

Arrows are set to these keys:

↑ - `w`
← - `a`
→ - `s`
↓ - `r`
straif left - `q`
straif right - `e`

Pick up an item?::`Mod + ↑`

Attack with a melee weapon?::`Mod + ← →`

Parry?::`Mod + ↓`

Punch?::`Mod + ↑`

Fire an arrow?::`Mod + ↑`

Use magic? `Mod + ↑`

Talk to an NPC? `Mod + ↑`

Open a door? `Mod + ↑`

Pick a lock on a door or chest? `Mod + ← →`

Drop an item from inventory? `Mod + ↓`

Move 1 item to/from inventory? `Mod + ← →`

Move 10 items to/from inventory? `Mod+a d` ?

Move 100 items to/from inventory? `Mod+Shift+a d` ?

- To select items to equip, open your inventory Tab and use ← → to browse the
categories. Can be equipped with `Mod + ↑`

- To punch, assume fighting stance first with `space`. To attack or parry with a
melee weapon, equip your weapon first with 1. To fire an arrow, equip your bow
first with 2. To cast spells, equip the magic spell first using 3 through 9
and 0.

- The process when dealing with looting chests, defeated foes or merchants is
mostly the same. To move through categories, press ← → without the USE key. The
only difference with merchants is that you move items from the merchant (left)
and items from your inventory (right) to the middle of the screen until you're
happy with the exchange and the value you offer equals or exceeds the value of
the goods from the merchant, then press `Enter` to finalize the deal.

If you want to climb something, stand close to it and hold down the jump button
`Alt` and `↑`.

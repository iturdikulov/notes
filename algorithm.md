# Algorithm

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name of a Persian
mathematician called 'Al-Khwārizmī', he is practically from my **homeland**.
(Persian: خوارزمی, c. 780–850).

In general, it's, set of finite step-by-step instructions for solving some
problem ([[logic|logical]] or [[mathematics|mathematical]]), or to perform some
other **task**, for example something from real world, like problem solving and
computation. In other words a strict set (sequence) of ==instructions== for
completing a specific task. <!--SR:!2024-10-13,16,192-->

Algorithm are used as specifications for performing computation and data
processing.

In computing, an algorithm is a precise list of operations that could be done by
a [[Turing_machine]]. For the purpose of [[computation|computing]], algorithms
are written in [[pseudocode]], [[flowchart]], or [[programming_language]].

Sometimes, it’s possible to have two different algorithms that accomplish the
same task [[computational_complexity|complexity]]. But one algorithm can be
faster/slower than the other by orders of magnitude.

Often there is more than one way to achieve a particular computing goal, and the
algorithm you choose can seriously affect the speed of your code.

Simple flowchart how I see programming and place of algorithms in it:

## Simplified terminology related to algorithms:

Algorithm time complexity is?::How long does it take to run algorithm X with N data. <!--SR:!2024-09-15,13,232-->

Algorithm space complexity::Amount of memory space required to solve algorithm X <!--SR:!2024-09-28,14,212-->
with N input data.

Formalized way to describe algorithm time and space complexity is ==Big O Notation==. <!--SR:!2024-10-01,18,192-->

How many computations will be used in algorithm X is an algorithmic ==efficiency=. <!--SR:!2024-08-24,1,175-->

# Godot Engine (game engine)

> Godot (/ˈɡɒdoʊ/) is a cross-platform, free and open-source [[Game|game]]
> engine released under the permissive MIT license. It was initially developed
> by Argentine software developers Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur for several
> companies in Latin America prior to its public release in 2014. The
> development environment runs on many platforms, and can export to several
> more. It is designed to create both 2D and 3D games targeting PC, mobile, and
> web platforms and can also be used to develop non-game software, including
> editors.\

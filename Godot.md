# Godot Engine (game engine)

> Godot (/ˈɡɒdoʊ/) is a cross-platform, free, and open-source [[game]] engine released under the permissive MIT license. It was initially developed by Argentine software developers Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur for several companies in Latin America prior to its public release in 2014. The development environment runs on many platforms, and can export to several more. It is designed to create both 2D and 3D games targeting PC, mobile, and web platforms and can also be used to develop non-game software, including editors.\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine))</cite>

Godot is good to develop [[3D_computer_graphics|3D]] games and various prototypes, it's supporting release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web.

Godot relies on the object-oriented programming paradigm (classes, objects).

Out-of-box supported [[GDScript]] programming language, and with the GDExtension technology C or C++.

I also have own [[gamedev#Godot]] learning path list.

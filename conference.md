# Conference

> particular subject, or to bring together people who have a common interest.
> Conferences can be used as a form of group decision-making, although
> discussion, not always decisions, is the primary purpose of conferences. The
> term derives from the word confer.\

I prefer technical conferences, which I visit mostly online.

My primary goal to visit conferences is to [[learning|learn]] something new
and be inspired by other people.

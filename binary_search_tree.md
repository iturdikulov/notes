# Binary search tree

> In [[computer_science]], a binary search [[tree]] (BST), also called an
> ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure with the
> key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective
> node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree. The time
> complexity of operations on the binary search tree is directly proportional to
> the height of the tree.\

A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the
principle of [[binary_search|binary_search]].

|           |             |                |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Algorithm | **Average** | **Worst case** |
| Space     | O(_n_)      | O(_n_)         |
| Search    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
| Insert    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |
| Delete    | O(log _n_)  | O(_n_)         |

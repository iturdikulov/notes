# Encyclopedia

> An encyclopedia (American English) or `encyclopædia` (British English) is a [[reference]] work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either general or special to a particular field or discipline. Encyclopedias are divided into [[articles]] or entries that are arranged alphabetically by article name or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and searchable. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title; this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use, and grammatical forms.\

I store some encyclopedias in `.zim` format, which can be opened in [[kiwix]].

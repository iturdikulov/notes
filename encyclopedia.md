# Encyclopedia

> An encyclopedia (American English) or `encyclopædia` (British English) is a
> [[reference]] work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge either
> general or special to a particular field or discipline. Encyclopedias are
> divided into [[articles]] or entries that are arranged alphabetically by
> article name or by thematic categories, or else are hyperlinked and
> searchable. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in
> most [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles
> focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's
> title; this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on linguistic
> information about words, such as their etymology, meaning, pronunciation, use,
> and grammatical forms.\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia)</cite>

I store some encyclopedias in `.zim` format, which can be opened in [[kiwix]].

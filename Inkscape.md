# Inkscape

> Inkscape is a free and open-source [[vector_graphics]] for GNU/Linux, Windows
> and macOS. It offers a rich set of features and is widely used for both
> artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos,
> typography, diagramming and flowcharting. It uses vector graphics to allow for
> sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution and is not bound to a
> fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses the standardized
> Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format as its main format, which is
> supported by many other applications including web browsers. It can import and
> export various other file formats, including SVG, AI, EPS, PDF, PS and PNG.\

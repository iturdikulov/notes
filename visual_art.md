# Visual arts

> The visual arts are art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, sculpture, ceramics, [[photography]], [[my_videos|video]], filmmaking, design, crafts, and architecture. Many artistic disciplines, such as performing arts, conceptual art, and textile arts, also involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types. Also included within the visual arts are the applied arts, such as industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, interior design, and decorative art.\

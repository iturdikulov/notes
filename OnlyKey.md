# OnlyKey

> OnlyKey was developed by a team of [[computer_security]] experts and white hat hackers to stop malicious hackers. One thing hackers and malware on a computer cannot do is physically touch something.
>
> In order to use OnlyKey to log in, physical touch is required. In order to read a secure message, physical touch is required.
>
> Our design is open source and reviewed by the community to verify that there are no backdoors. This just isn't possible with other closed source products.
>
> PIN PROTECTED When you first receive your OnlyKey the first step to set it up is to set a PIN. The PIN is entered directly on the OnlyKey PIN pad to activate OnlyKey. This provides the following advantages:
>
> Physical Security - If you lose your OnlyKey it is unusable without knowing the PIN. Protected on Untrusted Computer - The PIN is entered on OnlyKey instead of on a computer. Entering a PIN on a compromised computer would result in compromise of the PIN. Only One PIN to Remember - Protect all of your accounts with only one PIN to remember.\

## OnlyKey setup (pam.d) in archlinux

Be careful, pam rules applied immediately If you have issues, boot using live-iso usb drive, mount system (`mount /dev/.. /mnt`) and fix _etc/pam.d_ files.

```bash
# Install pam-u2f
sudo pacman -S pam-u2f

# Test u2f
sudo pamu2fcfg -u inom
# user>:ovvoovoaskdjalskdj....

# Prepare key
mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico && pamu2fcfg -u inom >> ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys

# Prepare pam config
cd /tmp
echo "auth required pam_u2f.so nodetect origin=pam://hostname appid=pam://hostname" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/u2f-required
echo "auth sufficient pam_u2f.so nodetect origin=pam://hostname appid=pam://hostname" | sudo tee -a /etc/pam.d/u2f-sufficient

# Edit and add
# /etc/pam.d/sudo
auth include u2f-sufficient
# validate sudo ls

# /etc/pam.d/system-auth
# add this in the end of first section
auth include u2f-required
reboot
```

# Computer programming

> Computer programming is the process of performing particular
> [[computation|computations]] (or more generally, accomplishing specific
> computing results), usually by designing and building executable
> [[computer_program|computer programs]]. Programming involves tasks such as
> analysis, generating [[algorithm|algorithms]], profiling algorithms' accuracy
> and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a
> particular programming language, commonly referred to as coding).\

Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation,
usually by designing/building an executable computer program, closely related to
[[computer_science]].

Programming is a big part of my life, I'm trying to learn it in a structured
way. Quality of learning resources is very important, but in same time learning
materials should be understandable and easy to follow. I collect resources about
programming, software development in my learning path.

## Learning path

Programming lerning path is closely related to
[[computer_science#Learning path|computer science learning path]].

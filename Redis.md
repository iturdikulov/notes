# Redis database

> Redis (/ˈrɛdɪs/; Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source in-memory
> storage, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and
> message broker, with optional durability. Because it holds all data in memory
> and because of its design, Redis offers low-latency reads and writes, making
> it particularly suitable for use cases that require a cache. Redis is the most
> popular NoSQL database, and one of the most popular databases overall. Redis
> is used in companies like Twitter, Airbnb, Tinder, Yahoo, Adobe, Hulu, and
> Amazon.\

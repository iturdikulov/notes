# 1. Whetting Your Appetite

In this section described when [[Python]] can be usable. For example, scripting, creating simple program with GUI, automate some daily work.

Also described strong points of Python, such as rapid development (write / compile / test / re-compile cycle), interactivity, extensibility, splitting into modules, simple integration, automation, batteries-included.

Python is ==[[Interpreter|interpreted]]== language, no compilation and linking is necessary (but possible with non-standard realizations). <!--SR:!2025-04-12,2,249-->

Python can be used as "glue language", to connect components together.

Main differences between [[C]], [[Java]], [[Go]] are:

- The high-level ==data types== allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
- Statement grouping is done by ==indentation== instead of beginning and ending brackets;
- Variable or argument declarations are ==not== necessary.

Primary Python programming paradigm is?
<br class="f">
Python is primarily [[OOP|object-oriented]] [[programming_language]], but also supports imperative, functional, and procedural paradigms. <!--SR:!2025-04-13,3,210-->

Python typing is?
<br class="f">
Python is dynamically typed. <!--SR:!2025-04-14,4,230-->

Python compiled or interpreted language?
<br class="f">
Interpreted language. <!--SR:!2025-04-28,18,250-->

Do python have garbage collection feature?
<br class="f">
Yes, memory management is done with automatic garbage collection. <!--SR:!2025-05-30,50,250-->

Is Python code readable (at least for most people)?
<br class="f">
Yes, known for being clear and concise with readable syntax, since used spaced indentation, simplified expression of complex things, etc. <!--SR:!2025-05-29,49,250-->

Is Python programs fast?
<br class="f">
Generally considered slower than compiled languages, but optimized for rapid development and readability, in recent years there significant performance improvements. <!--SR:!2025-04-27,17,250-->

Is Python high-level or low-level language?
<br class="f">
Python is [[high-level_programming_language]]. <!--SR:!2025-07-05,86,270-->

Can I create some product usually faster with Python?
<br class="f">
Usually yes, python features including rapid development and connecting various components of programming system. <!--SR:!2025-05-25,45,250-->

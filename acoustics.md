# Acoustics

> Acoustics is a branch of [[physics]] that deals with the study of mechanical
> waves in gases, liquids, and solids including topics such as vibration, sound,
> ultrasound and infrasound. A scientist who works in the field of acoustics is
> an acoustician while someone working in the field of acoustics technology may
> be called an acoustical engineer. The application of acoustics is present in
> almost all aspects of modern society with the most obvious being the audio and
> noise control industries.\
>
> Hearing is one of the most crucial means of survival in the animal world and
> speech is one of the most distinctive characteristics of human development and
> culture. Accordingly, the science of acoustics spreads across many facets of
> human society—music, medicine, architecture, industrial production, warfare
> and more.

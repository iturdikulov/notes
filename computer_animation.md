# Computer animation

> Computer [[animation]] is the process used for digitally generating
> animations. The more general term computer-generated imagery (CGI) encompasses
> both static scenes (still images) and dynamic images (moving images), while
> computer animation only refers to moving images. Modern computer animation
> usually uses [[3D_computer_graphics]] to generate a three-dimensional picture.
> The animation's target is sometimes the computer itself, while other times it
> is film.\

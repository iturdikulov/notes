# Machine code

Machine code is the ==set of numbers== that the CPU actually executes.

> In [[computer_programming]], machine code is computer [[code]] consisting of
> machine language instructions, which are used to control a computer's central
> processing unit (CPU). Although decimal computers were once common, the
> contemporary marketplace is dominated by binary computers; for those
> computers, machine code is "the binary representation of a computer program
> which is actually read and interpreted by the computer. A program in machine
> code consists of a sequence of machine instructions (possibly interspersed
> with data)".\

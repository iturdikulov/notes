# How to solve it

Describe how to solve general principles of solving problems.
&#10;<br>
> How to Solve It (1945) is a small volume by mathematician George Pólya
> describing methods of problem-solving.
>
> Four principles
>
> How to Solve It suggests the following steps when solving a mathematical problem:
>
>     First, you have to understand the problem.
>     After understanding, make a plan.
>     Carry out the plan.
>     Look back on your work. How could it be better?
>
> If this technique fails, Pólya advises: "If you cannot solve the proposed
> problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more
> accessible related problem?".\

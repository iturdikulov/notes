# The Useless Pages

The Useless Web was an example of early web humor. Original site you can find in [[internet_archive]] - [https://web.archive.org/web/20010616081433/http://www.go2net.com/useless/index.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20010616081433/http://www.go2net.com/useless/index.html).

I find them sometimes interesting and fun. Some of them can be source of [[artistic_inspiration|inspiration]] and ideas. They can be considered as sort of [[my_games|games]].

Here you can find random useless page: [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/).

# The Useless Pages

The Useless Web was an example of early web humor. Original site you can find in
[[internet_archive]] -
[https://web.archive.org/web/20010616081433/http://www.go2net.com/useless/index.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20010616081433/http://www.go2net.com/useless/index.html).

I find them sometimes interesting and fun. Some of them can be source of
[[artistic_inspiration|inspiration]] and
[[idea|ideas]].

Here you can find random useless page:
[The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/).

- [NYAN.CAT!](https://www.nyan.cat/index.php?cat=pirate)
- [Iceberger](https://joshdata.me/iceberger.html).
- [[chrome_experiments]] to certain degree can be considered as
useless pages too, but I'm not sure.
- [Neal.fun](https://neal.fun/) projects
  - [The Password Game](https://neal.fun/password-game/).
  - [Internet Artifacts](https://neal.fun/internet-artifacts/)

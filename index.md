# My notes, my projects and my life

[[about_me|I'm]] a programmer, who is trying to be a professional in the field
and stay a human being at the same time. My primary specialization is
[[backend]] web development, but I'm also interested in [[computer_graphics]],
game development and [[art]].

My site contains mainly my notes that are of interest of me, they are managed
with [[Zettelkasten]] methodology. I use them mostly to improve my
[[learning|education process]], store information that important for me and
share it with others. I will be pleased if you find something useful.

My notes are sort of "second brain", allow me choosing what to do **next**,
store long-term information and focus on important things:

- [[projects|Projects]] to do something interesting and useful.
- [[work|Work]] as main activity, [[finance]] source.
- [[learning|Learning]] is source of pet projects.
- [[my_awesome_software_list|Awesome software]] list help me to control and
learn "tools".
- [[media|Media]] collection, for relax and fun.

Almost [all notes](https://github.com/iturdikulov/notes) written in [[English]]
language, which isn't my primary one, so be ready for grammar mistakes.

## Contacts

For press or business inquiries, you can contact me via [[email]]. But please
**don't send me spam messages**, I might be interested in job offers or
something related to notes published on this site.

To get email address please try to use **one** of these methods:

1. If you have "modern" [[web_browser]] you can read it from the picture below.\
   ![my_email](./img/my_email.svg)

2. Combine my name in lowercase (`Inom`), the at sign (`@`), and current domain
  (`iturdikulov.com`), and you'll get full email address.

Other ways to contact me **maybe** I'll share through email contact channel.

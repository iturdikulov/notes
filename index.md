# Me and my [[Zettelkasten]] notes.

I keep my notes, mostly to improve my [[learning|education process]], store
important information (for me) and share it with others.

## Super global tasks

1. Programmer, problem-solver, self-learner, self-promoter, self-organizer;
2. Human being, who wants to be happy, healthy, kind, and wise;
3. Family member, who wants to be a good son and brother.

## whoami

I'm a software engineer, who is trying to be a professional in the field and
stay a human being at the same time ;-).

[[Taskwarrior]] with [[getting_things_done_GTD|GTD methodology]] helps me to
manage my life.

I have some global notes, which allow choosing what to do **next**:

- [[my_routine|Daily routine]], for more predictable life.
- [[work|Work]] as main activity, [[finance]] source.
- [[learning|Learning]] is source of pet projects.
- [[my_pet_projects|Pet projects]] to do something interesting and useful.
- [[IRL]] for social activities and socializing.
- [[my_physical_exercise_plan|Physical exercises]] to increase quality of life
- [[health|Health]] control and improvement.
- [[media|Media]] collection, for relax and fun.

## IRL

[[style_of_life|My style of life]] currently still chaotic, but I'm trying to
organize it. These notes are help me to do it.

Social connections are important to me and probably to my family and friends.
I'm connecting with them by voice calls, sometimes text messages and
[[IRL]]. I also store my [[how_do_I_work_with_contacts|contacts]] workflow.

Mentoring, I'm trying to help colleagues, people on [[GitHub]] projects,
[[Stack_Overflow|Stack Overflow]], etc.

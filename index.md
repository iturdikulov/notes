# My notes, my projects, and my life

[[about_me|I'm]] a programmer, who is trying to be a professional in the field and stay a human being at the same time. My primary specialization is [[backend]] [[web_development]]. 

My website contains mainly my notes that are of interest of me, they are managed with [[Zettelkasten]] methodology. I use them mostly to improve my [[learning|education process]], store information that important for me and share it with others. I will be pleased if you find something useful.

My notes are sort of "second brain", allow me choosing what to do **next**, store long-term information and focus on important things:

- [[my_goals|Goals]] to understand my priorities.
- [[projects|Projects]] to do something interesting and useful.
- [[work|Work]] as main activity, [[finance]] source.
- System Design
- [[life|Life]] as communication, teamwork, saving life-balance and improving mentoring abilities.
- [[media|Media]] collection, for relax and fun.
- [[learning|Learning]] is source of pet projects and [[knowledge]].
- [[computer_science|Computer science]] to practice algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning.
- [[computer_programming|Computer programming]] to practice and empower problems-solving abilities.
- [[computer_performance|Performance]] to focus on fast products.
- [[computer_security|Security]] and [[cryptography]] to implement secure code and data protection.
- [[computer_graphics|Computer graphics]], [[gamedev|game development]] and [[art]] as side interests.
- [[my_awesome_software_list|Awesome software]] list help me to control and learn "tools".

Almost [all notes](https://github.com/iturdikulov/notes) written in [[English]] language, which isn't my primary one, so be ready for grammar mistakes. This notes is also my great English practice project.
Some notes written in [[Russian]] (search for `.ru`).

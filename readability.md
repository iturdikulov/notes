# Readability

> Readability, or textual difficulty, means how easy or hard a text is to read. Research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read. How difficult the **words** are: this is lexical difficulty. Rare words are less well known than common words. Rare, difficult words are often longer than common, easy words. How difficult the **sentences** are: this is syntactical difficulty. Long, complicated sentences cause more difficulty than short, simple sentences.\

> Readability exists in both natural language and programming languages though in different forms. In programming, things such as programmer comments, choice of loop structure, and choice of names can determine the ease with which humans can read computer program code.\

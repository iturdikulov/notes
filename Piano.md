# Piano

> The piano is a **keyboard [[My_Music|musical]] instrument** with strings
> struck by wooden hammers coated with a softer material (modern hammers are
> covered with dense wool felt; some early pianos used leather). It is played
> using its keyboard, which is a row of keys (small levers) touched by the
> performer with the fingers and thumbs of both hands, causing the hammers to
> strike the strings. It was invented in Italy by Bartolomeo Cristofori around
> the year 1700.\

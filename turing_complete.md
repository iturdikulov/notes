# Turing completeness

> In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a model
> of computation, a computer's instruction set, a
> [[programming_language|programming language]], or a cellular automaton) is
> said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it
> ==can be used to simulate any [[turing_machine|Turing machine ]]==
> (devised by English
> mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing). This means that this system
> is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing
> completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation
> rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete.
>
> A related concept is that of Turing equivalence – two computers P and Q are
> called equivalent if P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P. The Church–Turing
> thesis conjectures that any function whose values can be computed by an
> algorithm can be computed by a Turing machine, and therefore that if any
> real-world computer can simulate a Turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to
> a Turing machine. A universal Turing machine can be used to simulate any
> Turing machine and by extension the computational aspects of any possible
> real-world computer.\

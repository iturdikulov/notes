# Miniflux

> Miniflux is a minimalist and opinionated feed reader.\

I tried various RSS readers. But I chose Miniflux for these reasons:

- Integrated with web browser, I can quickly open URL, even watch video, listen
  to podcast, or read article.
- Simple and clean interface.
- Customizable.
- Full-featured for me (categories, feeds, etc.).
- Mobile friendly.

I'm still in process of using RSS habitually. I'm trying to use it for all inbox
news, tweets, posts, videos, etc. Something like News Inbox.

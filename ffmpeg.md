# FFmpeg - A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video.

> FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
> mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
> machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
> cutting edge. No matter if they were designed by some standards committee, the
> community or a corporation. It is also highly portable: FFmpeg compiles, runs,
> and passes our testing infrastructure FATE across Linux, Mac OS X, Microsoft
> Windows, the BSDs, Solaris, etc. under a wide variety of build environments,
> machine architectures, and configurations.\

I widely use FFmpeg in various wrappers and sometimes directly. Best example is
slightly modified [Luke Smith's](https://lukesmith.xyz/)
[ffmpeg screen record script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/master/.local/bin/dmenurecord).

TODO: place my version here.

## [How to Add Chapters to MP4s with FFmpeg - Kyle Howells](https://ikyle.me/blog/2020/add-mp4-chapters-ffmpeg)

Get existing video metadata

`ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -f ffmetadata FFMETADATAFILE`

Check there are no existing chapters.
Watch the video, noting chapters into a `chapters.txt` file as you go.
Place `FFMETADATAFILE`, `chapters.txt`, and the video file in the same directory.

chapters.txt example:

    0:23:20 Start
    0:40:30 First Performance
    0:40:56 Break
    1:04:44 Second Performance
    1:24:45 Crowd Shots
    1:27:45 Credits

Run the helper script to append chapters to `FFMETADATAFILE`.

`ffmpeg_chapters_generate`

Create a new video, copying the video and audio from the original without re-encoding.

`ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -i FFMETADATAFILE -map_metadata 1 -codec copy OUTPUT.mp4`

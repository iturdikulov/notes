# My everyday life (routine)

Without routine, you can skip many important things and lose your discipline and
motivation. I split my working day into core chunks, and I follow them every
day.

Here is high-level diagram of my routine:

## 1. Wake up

- Go easy after wake-up, get (5-10mins) natural light in eyes within 1 hour of
  waking up.
- Washing my face with cold water and brush teeth.
- Drink a glass of coffee.
- Prepare workspace, fewer distractions improve my productivity.
- Put devices on charger - daily (phone, tablet, big headphones), weekly
  (e-reader, small headphones).
- **Planning** my day with [[Taskwarrior]].
- 35 minutes of run session.
- Take a shower with cold water (at least in the end).

## 2. Work session, focusing on the most important tasks ~ 3 hours

- Disable distractions (`dnd`), prepare water, breath deeply and start.
- Warmup a little with easy to-do tasks, then go to most important ones.
- Focus on **main tasks**, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks, to avoid go too deep, we can always go back and
  refactor/improve features.
- Take at least one 10â€“15 minutes break in this session.
- Drink more water to stay hydrated.
- Completeing this working session give me good emotional state.
- Pain is rewareded with pleasure, don't be afraid to do something booring but
  really useful.

## 3. Dinner

- Slowly eat good meal, give time to food **digestion**.
- Walk a little-bit.
- This is brainless time, don't try to do something important.
- After ~1.5 I'm usually falling into microsleep (max 30 minutes).

## 4. Post-work session

Closing gaps, review my work and commit it, connecting with my team, and prepare
me to the next day.

## 5. After-work session

Dinner time. I get some rest and recovery time. Maybe it's good time
for tea or some other drink with small amount of food.

I like to get some "relax" time, to give my mind some time to recover. Maybe
I'll watch something or read something.

After relax its good time to [[my_physical_exercise_plan#Physical exercise
plan]], with tracking my progress and results.

## 6. Learn something new

This chunk is starting somewhere in the evening, when I get second wind.
I learn according to [[learning]] techniques. I also mix learning and practice
in one session.

## 7. Relax

Before sleeping, I may do full relax activity, like reading, watching movies,
playing games, etc.

## 9. Sleep

Sleep is key of productivity, synchronize with circadian rhytm clocks.

Don't forget about yourself and don't try to make longer your day (this is bad
idea). Try to start sleep maximum at 00:00 (with some preparations before),
breath deeply and keep thinking about something good.

## Dophamine

Try to increase Dophamine through your daily routine.

- Exercise.
- Protein.
- Reduce saturated fat.
- Support gut health.
- Sunlight.
- Regular sleep.
- Meditation.
- Music.

# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

I split my working day into core chunks, and I'm trying to follow them every day.

Here is high-level diagram of my routine:

![[./img/daily_routine_chunks.excalidraw]]
_My daily routine_

## 1. Wake up

Good checklist for wake-up:

- Wash your face and brush your teeth, both are important.
- Drink a glass of water (or coffee ðŸ˜ˆ).
- Prepare your workspace, fewer distractions improve your productivity.
- Put your devices on charger.
- Learn something new.
- Do basic training, 35+ minutes sessions (in my case run).
- Walk outside for 10â€“20 minutes to get enough energy from sun (vitamin D).

## 2. TODO

Things-to-do (AKA to-do list), planning my day is my first chunk of the day.
Here I prepare my day, week, month, etc.

Priorities:

- Schedule anything unimportant and which I not plan to do today, be honest.
- Check your [[work#Goals|goals]], expertness, health, family tasks, etc.
- Review your calendar and tasks, maybe something has high-priority.
- Plan something important (3 high-level tasks), for combinatorial explosion.
- Mark completed tasks.

## 3. Chunk \#1. Deep work session, focusing on the most critical tasks

Disable distractions, prepare water, breath deeply few minutes and start.

Main goals:

- Bring your mind to the task (5-minute meditation if needed).
- Time amount about 3 hours.
- Reduce distractions, let know everyone you will be **busy**.
- Focus on **main tasks**, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks.
- Take at least one 10â€“15 minutes break in this session.
- Drink more water to stay hydrated.

Completed important task give me emotional charge and motivation.

## 4. Chunk \#2. Less demanding tasks

After main working time I give my mind some relax time. Give rest to your eyes
and mind and fuel your body and give time to food **digestion**.

This is good time to do something brainless, with low energy consumption. But
**don't** sleep immediately after lunch and for long time.

Finish started tasks, connect with people, help them if you can.

## 5. Workout and Dinner

Only morning physical activity is not enough for me. I need to do some
additional physical activity.

Regular work-out are important for better energy and healthy mind. Better to do
it according [[my_physical_exercise_plan#Physical exercise plan]] and track your
progress and results.

Dinner time. After workout, I get rest and recovery time. Maybe it's good time
for tea or some other drink with some food (not a lot).

## 6. Learn something new

This chunk is starting in the evening. I need to learn something new. Without
this process I don't really do any progress, I think it's also interesting and
fun sometimes. I learn according to [[learning]] techniques. I usually spend
some time to learn before this chunk, this is also good time to review learned
information with [[spaced_repetition]] technique.

## 7. Fun

It's good time to practice learned information by working with [[projects]].
Sometimes you haven't energy for it, it's fine. You can do something else.

It's also good time for [[life]] activities.

## 8. Relax

You need to give your bran and mind some time to relax. At this time I can
consume some [[media]], read [[my_fiction_books|fiction books]], listen music,
etc.

Some tasks before sleep:

- Place E-devices on charger.
- Review your working profiles, social networks.
- Upload videos, photos, articles, etc.

## 9. Sleep

Don't forget about yourself and don't try to make longer your day (this is bad
idea). Try to start sleep maximum at 00:00 (with some preparations before),
breath deeply and keep thinking about something good.

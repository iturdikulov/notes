# My everyday life (routine)

Routine is a recommendation not a strict law. But without routine you can skip
many important things and lose your discipline and motivation.

I split my working day into 8 chunks, and I'm trying to follow them every day.

Here is diagram of my routine:

![[./img/daily_routine_chunks.excalidraw]]

## Prepare To-do. Wake-up, Plan and Run

Initialization, want to do good wake-up, care about my body, warm-up and walk.
Wake-up with good moon, make your day better. I feel better if I wake up at 8:00
am.

Good checklist for wake-up:

- Wash your face and brush your teeth, both are important.
- Drink a glass of water (or coffee ðŸ˜ˆ).
- Plan something important, for combinatorial explosion.
- Review your calendar and tasks, maybe something has high-priority.
- Do basic training, 35+ minutes sessions (in my case run).
- Walk outside for 10â€“20 minutes to get enough energy from sun (vitamin D).
- Prepare your workspace, fewer distractions.

## Chunk 1.1 Big guy

Schedule anything unimportant and disable distractions, prepare water, breath
deeply few minutes and start.

Main goals:

- Time amount about 3 hours.
- Reduce distractions, let know everyone you will be busy.
- Focus on main tasks, go from hard to easy or important to less important.
- Limit timing for tasks.
- Take at least one 10â€“15 minutes break in this session.
- Drink more water to stay hydrated.

Completed important task give me emotional charge and motivation.

## Lunch

After main working time I give my mind some relax time.

You can prepare your lunch in the morning or in the evening. Give rest to your
eyes and mind and fuel your body and give time to food **digestion**.

This is good time to do something brainless, with low energy consumption. But
**don't** sleep immediately after lunch and for long time.

Personally it's hard for me to do something brain-related after lunch some time,
and I need about 1â€“2 hours to recover.

## Chunk 1.1 Big guy chunk completion

Complete main tasks, connect with people, help them. Mark completed tasks. You
can also work in this time on side projects, freelance, self-promotion or other
tasks if you are not busy with working tasks.

## Workout

Only morning physical activity is not enough for me. I need to do some
additional physical activity. It's good to do it after work.

Regular work-out are important for better energy and healthy mind. Better to do
it according [[my_physical_exercise_plan|plan]] and track your progress and
results. But I'm not trying to get Olympics medal, so I don't do very
high-intensive workouts.

## Chunk 2. Learn

This task can reuse information from [[#Chunk 1.1 Big guy]]. But I need to learn
according to [[learning]] techniques.

## Chunk 3. Fun

It's good time to practice learned information by working with
[[my_pet_projects|pet projects]]. Sometimes you haven't energy for it, it's
fine. You can do something else.

## Prepare for tomorrow

Starting somewhere in 22:00-23:00 pm. I stop doing anything heavy brain energy
consuming.

- Plan your day, week, month, year, life.
- Check your [[work#Goals|goals]], expertness, health, family and calendar.
- Place E-devices on charger.
- Review your working profiles, social networks.
- Upload videos, photos, articles, etc.

## Chunk 4. Relax

You need to give your bran and mind some time to relax. At this time I can
consume some [[media]], read [[my_fiction_books|fiction books]], listen
not-agressie music, etc.

Don't forget about yourself and don't try to make longer your day (this is bad
idea). Try to start sleep maximum at 00:00, breath deeply and keep thinking
about something good.

# Health and "beauty"

> In common usage and medicine, health, according to the World Health
> Organization, is "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being
> and not merely the absence of disease and infirmity". A variety of definitions
> have been used for different purposes over time. Health can be promoted by
> encouraging healthful activities, such as regular
> [[my_physical_exercise_plan|physical exercise]] and adequate [[sleep]],
> and by reducing or avoiding unhealthful activities or situations, such as
> smoking or excessive stress. Some factors affecting health are due to
> individual choices, such as whether to engage in a high-risk behavior, while
> others are due to structural causes, such as whether the society is arranged
> in a way that makes it easier or harder for people to get necessary healthcare
> services. Still, other factors are beyond both individual and group choices,
> such as genetic disorders.\

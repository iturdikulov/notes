## Modding

### Manual (steam)


### Skyrim

Basically I install Mod Organizer 2 and some recommended mods.

Simplified Mod Organizer 2 installation guide:
[steamtinker](https://github.com/sonic2kk/steamtinkerlaunch/wiki/Mod-Organizer-2).

- **[Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64)](https://skse.silverlock.org/)** - This is
explained and linked in the Beginner's Guide. Required to run a number of
essential or "Highly recommended" mods.
  - Optional Add-on:
    [SKSE.ini
    download](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1651) -
    For those of you too lazy to set up the skse.ini yourselves, you can
    download it here and install like any other mod

- **Unofficial Patches** *[PC](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/?)*
  This fixes thousands of bugs. Again, if you followed through with the
  Beginner's Guide you should have this installed and sorted already.

- **SkyUI** - Considered essential because of the Mod Configuration
  Menu, which a lot of other mods rely on. Again, this is outlined and
  installed in the Beginner's Guide.

- **[SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230)** -
  Fixes a number of engine bugs present in the Special Edition and
  Classic, including decoupling waterflow to the in-game timer, double
  perk bug, "false save corruption" bug, and more. Similar to "Crash
  Fixes". Read the description to see all of the present features.

#### Highly Suggested Mods

- **[More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250)** -
  Replaces the console UI to show a great deal of information related to
  what is being targeted (actors, objects, etc.). Similar to MFG Console
  in Classic Skyrim, but more.

- **[Modern Brawl Bug Fix](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1473/?)** -
  from the USKP wiki: bugfixes that pertain to brawling while also under
  the influence of cloak spells of various types. See mod description
  for a better explanation.

- **[Better Dialogue Controls](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1429/?)** -
  Improves the dialogue boxes in game to work with keyboard+mouse. No
  more accidentally saying the wrong thing!

- **[Better MessageBox Controls](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1428/?)** -
  Same as the previous mod, but applies to all other message boxes
  (skill trees, map, etc)

- **[Realistic Ragdolls and Force](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1439/?)** -
  Exactly what it says.

- **[Particle and Subsurface Scattering Patch](http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1499)** -
  Does not require ENB and will fix glowing waterfalls/streams and make
  light reflections look more natural.

- **[Flora Respawn Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13186/)** -
  Fixes an issue where flora won't respawn after harvesting no matter
  how long you wait.

- **[Fixed Dragon Stalking Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37230)** -
  For the last time, I've told you I'm seeing other dragons! Please stop
  showing up out of the blue like this...

#### Optional Mods:

- **[Cutting Room Floor](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276/?)** -
  This is a result of unfinished content created by bethesda but not
  included in the final release (most likely due to time constraints).
  This mod restores and finishes that content.

- **[The Choice Is Yours](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850/?)** -
  You now have the option to decline quests. No more journal full of
  crap simply because you overheard a conversation or read a book.

- **[Alternate Start - Live Another Life](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272/?)**
   - The carriage ride intro to Skyrim is a very script heavy (and very
  fragile) piece of Skyrim. Quite a few mods can break this intro due to
  additional script latency. ASLAL lets you bypass the carriage ride and
  choose from one of many different starting points designed for
  roleplay


- **[A Quality World Map](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5804/?)** -
  Greatly improves the look of the map. Makes route planning *so* much
  easier. A must if you don't use fast travel.

- **[Cobb Controlmap Fix](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1237/?)** -
  Allows you to unbind gameplay keys from menu keys, so that changing
  Activate to something other than "E" won't also ghost-change Use in
  menus to that other key.

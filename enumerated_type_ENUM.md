# Enumerated type

> In [[computer_programming|computer programming]], an enumerated type (also
> called enumeration, enum, or factor in the R programming language, and a
> categorical variable in statistics) is a data type consisting of a set of
> named values called elements, members, enumeral, or enumerators of the type.
> The enumerator names are usually identifiers that behave as constants in the
> language. An enumerated type can be seen as a degenerate tagged union of unit
> type. A variable that has been declared as having an enumerated type can be
> assigned any of the enumerators as a value.
>
> In other words, an enumerated type has values that are different from each
> other, and that can be compared and assigned, but are not specified by the
> programmer as having any particular concrete representation in the computer's
> memory; compilers and interpreters can represent them arbitrarily.
>
> Some early programming languages did not originally have enumerated types. If
> a programmer wanted a variable, for example myColor, to have a value of red,
> the variable red would be declared and assigned some arbitrary value, usually
> an integer constant. The variable red would then be assigned to myColor. Other
> techniques assigned arbitrary values to strings containing the names of the
> enumerators.
>
> These arbitrary values were sometimes referred to as magic [[number|numbers]]
> since there often was no explanation as to how the numbers were obtained or
> whether their actual values were significant. These magic numbers could make
> the source code harder for others to understand and maintain.\

# Government

> A government is the system or group of people governing an organized
> community, generally a state. In the case of its broad associative definition,
> government normally consists of **legislature**, **executive**, and
> **judiciary**. Government is a means by which organizational policies are
> enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. In many countries,
> the government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing
> principles and philosophy.\

# English Capitalization Rules

Certain words, like proper nouns and the ==first== word in a sentence, start
with a capital letter.

## When to capitalize

Basically, there are three types of words you capitalize in English:

- the pronoun "_I_"
- the first word in a sentence or line of a letter (e.g., _Sincerely_)
- proper nouns

That last one, proper nouns, is where a lot of the confusion comes from. Some
words, like the name _Albert Einstein_, are always capitalized; however, others
are capitalized only in certain situations and are lowercase in others. For
example, directions like _north_ and _west_ are normally lowercased but are
capitalized when they’re used as part of a geographic name, like the _West
Coast_.

Let’s take a closer look at what words need to be capitalized and when.

## What words need to be capitalized?

### People’s names

Both the first and last names of a person are capitalized. Likewise, middle
names, nicknames, and suffixes like _Jr._ are also capitalized.

_Martin Luther King Jr._

_Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson_

Historical names that include descriptive words often follow the rules for title
capitalization: Prominent words are capitalized, but small words like _the_ or
_of_ are not.

_Ivan the Terrible_

_Maria of Aragon_

### Titles

Capitalization in titles is where a lot of capitalization errors come from. The
title of any piece of work—books, movies, songs, poems, podcast episodes,
comic-book issues, etc. — requires capitalization, but only certain words in the
title are capitalized.

What words need to be capitalized in titles?
&#10;<br>
For starters, the first word in a title is always capitalized. Nouns, pronouns,
verbs, adjectives, and adverbs all need to be capitalized in titles as well.

Small words like articles and prepositions are generally lowercased, unless
they’re the first word in a title. However, some style guides have their own
preferences, so double-check if you have any doubts. Examples:
\
- _The Catcher in the Rye_
- _Of Mice and Men_

### Places

If you’re using the name of a place, capitalize it. This applies to everything
from tiny Deer Creek to the massive planet Jupiter.

_New York City_

_Lake Victoria_

Keep in mind that if you are **not** using the name of a place but the general
word to describe it, you do not capitalize that word.

_The Grand Canyon is a good canyon, but I wouldn’t call it “grand.”_

### Countries, nationalities, and languages

In English, countries, nationalities, and languages are capitalized. Country
names fall under the category of places, but by extension the names of the
people who live there and the adjective form of their culture are also
capitalized. This includes languages.

_Haiti_

_a team of Haitians_

_Haitian cuisine_

### Institutions (companies, brands, agencies, etc.)

The names of companies, brands, agencies, and other large groups like hospitals
are also proper nouns. Some small words like prepositions may still be
lowercased in such names.

_Volkswagen Group_

_Bank of China_

If you’re referring to a department by its proper name, you can capitalize it.
However, if you’re referring to a general department, keep it lowercased.

_“She works in the Psychology Department.”_

_“I didn’t even know our school had a psychology department.”_

### Historical eras

Capitalize periods and events when referring to them by their specific name but
not when you’re using them as general terms. If a period of time is named after
a proper noun, capitalize the proper noun. The word for the period is sometimes
capitalized, as in the examples below, but other times it is lowercased, as in
_the Victorian age_.

_European Renaissance_

_Islamic Golden Age_

Generally, you do **not** capitalize the names of centuries because they are too
broad.

_the twentieth century_

### Days, months, and holidays

In English days and months are capitalized because they are proper nouns.

_the first Sunday in April_

When words like _day_ or _month_ are used generally, they are not capitalized.
However, if they are part of a holiday name, they count as a proper noun and are
capitalized.

_What day is Father’s Day?_

### Initials and acronyms

Initials and [acronyms](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/acronym/) combine the
first letters of multiple words to make a new word. Typically, these use all
capital letters.

_WHO (World Health Organization)_

_UFO (Unidentified Flying Object)_

However, some acronyms are used so often, they become separate words and use
lowercase letters instead. For example, the word _scuba_ started as an acronym
for *self-contained underwater breathing apparatus—*now it’s a common word on
its own, so it’s spelled in lowercase letters.

## Words that are _sometimes_ capitalized

### Family titles

The
[capitalization of family titles](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-family-title/)
is a confusing topic. Family titles like _mom_ or _uncle_ can be
[either](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/either-vs-neither/) proper nouns or
common nouns. In short, capitalize them when they’re used as proper nouns but
lowercase them when they’re used as common nouns.

_I have to ask my dad._

_Can I go to the movies, Dad?_

When family titles are used as common nouns, there is usually an article (_the_,
_a_, _an_) or a possessive noun (_my_, _your_, _our_, etc.) in front of them. If
you see an article or a possessive noun, it means keep the family title
lowercase.

_My uncle hates when I call him Uncle Joe because it makes him feel old._

### Beginnings of quotations

Another confusing topic is
[capitalization in quotes](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-in-quotes/).
The most important thing to know is whether the quote is a complete sentence or
a [sentence fragment](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/sentence-fragment/). If the
quote is a complete sentence, it starts with a capital letter, even if it begins
in the middle of the sentence.

_Marie Antoinette never actually said, “Let them eat cake.”_

If the quote is a sentence fragment, do not capitalize it. This is most common
when you’re quoting only a specific word or phrase instead of a long passage.

_The substitute teacher called our class “goonish and unruly.”_

### After a colon

[Capitalization after colons](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/capitalization-after-colons/)
depends on what the colon is used for. If a colon is used to introduce a list,
do not use capitalization.

_Here’s what we need at the grocery store: blueberries, strawberries, and
whipped cream._

If the colon is used to introduce an independent clause, capitalization is
optional. However, different style guides have different preferences, so
double-check with whatever format you’re using.

_There are plenty of reasons to plant a garden: First and foremost, it’s a lot
of fun._

## When to capitalize seasons

[Are seasons capitalized?](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/are-seasons-capitalized/)
In general, the seasons—spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter—are not
capitalized. They use lowercase just like other common nouns.

_Last winter and spring were so bad, this summer has to be better._

However, often seasons are used in titles, especially in fashion. In this case,
they are part of a proper noun, and so they are capitalized.

_Hermès’s Fall 2022 collection was even better than Prada’s Spring 2021
collection._

## When to capitalize job titles

Just like the seasons, job titles, positions, or honorifics are sometimes
capitalized and sometimes lowercased. When these titles are used as part of a
proper name, they are capitalized; when they refer to the general job or
position, they are lowercased.

_The next president may be from a different region than President Mujica._

Likewise, honorifics like _Mr_. and _Ms_. are capitalized when used before a
name.

## English capitalization rules FAQs

is capitalized. Specifically, the pronoun _I_, the first word of a sentence, and
proper nouns like names are capitalized.

titles of works, nationalities, languages, institutions like companies,
historical eras, days, months, holidays, initials, and acronyms.

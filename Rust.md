# Rust (programming language)

> Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety—meaning that all references point to valid memory — without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its =="borrow checker"== tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation.\

# Daemon_(computing)

> In multitasking computer [[OS|operating systems]], a daemon is
> a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under
> the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of
> a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is in fact
> a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer
> program. For example, syslogd is a daemon that implements system logging
> facility, and sshd is a daemon that serves incoming SSH connections.\
>
> In a [[Unix]] environment, the parent process of a daemon is often, but not
> always, the init process. A daemon is usually created either by a process
> forking a child process and then immediately exiting, thus causing init to
> adopt the child process, or by the init process directly launching the daemon.

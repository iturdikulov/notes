# C programming language

C is multi-paradigm programming language (I started learn it later than needed
üòº). By design work efficiently with typical machine instructions.

It\'s some like low-level programming language (but C is high-level and
general-purpose programming language). It's support functional/procedure
programming paradigm.

C common used in OS development, microcontroller firmware development,
databases, game development, utilities, etc.

## ANSI C

> ANSI C, ISO C, and Standard C are successive standards for the [[C]]
> programming language published by the American National Standards Institute
> (ANSI) and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 14 of the International Organization for
> Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
> Historically, the names referred specifically to the original and
> best-supported version of the standard (known as C89 or C90). Software
> developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing
> so helps portability between compilers.\

## How to type 100 words per minute

> I spent too much time trying to improve my typing speed by doing the wrong
things. After much experimentation and many dead ends, I discovered several
techniques to consistently boost my typing speed by 5 wpm at a time. Repeating
this process allowed me to exceed 100 wpm so Iâ€™ll share the techniques as well
as my mistakes to save you from repeating them.

> by using all your fingers.

So limit isn't physical, it's mental/brain. I especially have some difficult,
because I'm not native English speaker. TODO: Check this when I reach 100+ wpm
ðŸ˜€.

> We usually type on keyboard at 80% of our top speed so whatever speed you
> envision to be ideal for your profession, add an extra 25% to it when thinking
> about the speed to aim for in typing tests.

I think this number much less, when you tired or when you're not in the mood.

He recommends buying a mechanical keyboard, which I already have, and I like it.

## More recommendations with my notes:

1. "Proper posture is important as minor discomforts get amplified over time." I
   agree, and definitely need to improve my posture. And combine it with
[[my_physical_exercise_plan]].

2. "Measure your progress often" If I use training tools, I'll measure my
   progress often.

3. "Donâ€™t restart the test if you start making mistakes." I need stop doing it!

4. "Take one step at a time" I need stay calm, don't rush and progress slowly,
   as needed

5. "Prefer short and frequent sessions" [[spaced_repetition]] also can be
   applied here

6. "Pressing keys" Use chords for typing (I think its native method). Prefer
   light-typing. Practice double-typing each finger for light-typing.

7. "Finger placement" I'm usually following these rules, finger position, thumb
   for space and type abbreviation with both hands.

8. "Dealing with mistakes"

   - Priorities to train: accuracy; rhythm; ...
   - Use <kbd>c</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd> instead <kbd>backspace</kbd>.

9. "Transition between words" Keep home row finger position, after typing a
   word. Make it muscle memory.

10. "Mental model"
    > Memorize the relative offset for each finger from its resting position on
    > the home row

I created fingers relative positions map to help me with this.

11. "Use a typing trainer to re-enforce the mental model"

Refer to [[touch_typing]] for more details.

11. "Donâ€™t look at the keyboard"

Yeah! I usually don't look at the keyboard.

12. "Master fundamentals before continuing"

- You type each key with the correct finger.
- You type without looking at the keyboard.
- You return your fingers to the home row before starting the next word.
- Your accuracy is at least 95%. If your accuracy is lower, slow down and
  increase your accuracy with Keybr as accuracy is very important before
  continuing.
- Your individual key speeds stopped increasing the last few days on Keybr.

13. "Change your pace for each word"

Dynamic rhythm is fine. So I can slow down for long words and speed up for short
words.

14. "Look at the next word while typing the current word"

It's natural behavior, so I don't need to force myself to do it.

15. "Reset your typing noise tempo"

Need typo in silence? Usually I do it.

16. "Type using rolls"

So need use predicted patterns, various lessons, etc.

17. "Build a vocabulary of words"

I think monkey typing is good for this. And it has code vocabulary.

18. "Aim for 5 WPM higher than your current speed and practice each set of 50
    words until reaching that target."

So need constantly change lessons after you raised some point of speed.

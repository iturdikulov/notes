## How to type 100 words per minute

> I spent too much time trying to improve my typing speed by doing the wrong
> things. After much experimentation and many dead ends, I discovered several
> techniques to consistently boost my typing speed by 5 wpm at a time. Repeating
> this process allowed me to exceed 100 wpm, so I’ll share the techniques as
> well as my mistakes to save you from repeating them. If you can tap each
> finger just twice per second then you can exceed 100 wpm by using all your
> fingers.

> We usually type on keyboard at 80% of our top speed so whatever speed you

> about the speed to aim for in typing tests.

I think this number much less, when you tired or when you're not in the mood.

He recommends buying a mechanical keyboard, which I already have, and I like it.

## More recommendations with my notes:

1. Why is proper posture important for typing, and what should you combine it
   with?
   <br class="f">
   "Proper posture is important as minor discomforts get amplified (if you
   haven't proper one) over time". I agree, and definitely need to improve my
   posture. And combine it with [[my_physical_exercise_plan]]. <!--SR:!2025-02-03,2,248-->

2. What benefit do training tools provide for progress measurement?
   <br class="f">
   "Measure your progress often". Training tools help you measure your progress
   objectively and frequently.

3. What bad habit should you avoid when making mistakes during typing tests?
   <br class="f">
   "Don’t restart the test if you start making mistakes".
   Keep going to practice error recovery.

4. What mindset should you adapt to avoid rushing while typing?
   <br class="f">
   "Take one step at a time". I need **stay calm**, don't rush and progress
   slowly, as needed.

5. How can [[spaced_repetition]] principles apply to typing practice?
   <br class="f">
   "Prefer short but frequent sessions". [[spaced_repetition]] also can be
   applied here.

6. What two techniques help achieve light, efficient keystrokes?
   <br class="f">
   "Pressing keys". Use **chords** for typing (I think it natural method). Prefer
   **light-typing**. Practice double-typing each finger for light-typing.

7. Which finger should press the spacebar, and how should abbreviations be typed?
   <br class="f">
   "Finger placement". I'm usually following these rules, finger position, thumb
   for space and type abbreviation with both hands, I have hack with my [[QMK]]
   frimware: press double shift keys to type next word in uppercase.

8. What are the priorities for mistake management, and what shortcut improves
   efficiency of word re-typing?
   <br class="f">
   "Dealing with mistakes".
   - Priorities to train: accuracy; rhythm; ...
   - Use <kbd>c</kbd>+<kbd>backspace</kbd> instead <kbd>backspace</kbd>.

9. How to maintain smooth transitions between typing words?
   <br class="f">
   "Transition between words". Keep home row finger position, after typing a
   word. Make it muscle memory.

10. What mental remembering model helps with air-typing practice?
   <br class="f">
   "Mental model". Memorize the relative offset for each finger from its resting
   position on the home row.

11. How do typing trainers ([[touch_typing]]) reinforce the mental model to
    improve your typing skills?
    <br class="f">
    They provide structured practice to strengthen correct finger movements.

12. Should you look at the keyboard while typing?
    <br class="f">
    "Don’t look at the keyboard". This greatly improve your typing speed in long
    term by bypassing switch context time and build muscle memory. I usually
    don't look at the keyboard and I even have keycaps without letters.

13. "Master fundamentals before continuing"
    <br class="f">
    - You type each key with the correct ==finger==.
    - You type without looking at the ==keyboard==.
    - You return your fingers to the ==home row== before starting the next word.
    - Your accuracy is at least ==95%==. If your accuracy is lower, slow down
      and increase your accuracy, it's very important before continuing.
    - Your individual key speeds stopped increasing the last few days, so it's
      time to change ==lessons==.

14. How should you adjust speed for different words?
    <br class="f">
    "Change your pace for each word". Dynamic rhythm is fine. So I can slow down
    for long words and speed up for short words.

14. "Look at the next word while typing the current word". Is this a good idea?
    <br class="f">
    Yes, and It's natural behavior for me, so I do it automatically.

15. "Reset your typing noise tempo". Is this a good idea?
    <br class="f">
    Yes, co-workers and family will be happy, and in same time I think it's
    increase consistency.

16. "Type using rolls". What's the best way to practice rolls?
    <br class="f">
    Rolls is sequential finger movements, you can do them on table. Need to
    practice with tools and some known patterns, maybe best is try to practice
    on hard words.

17. How to practice special set of words?
    <br class="f">
    "Build a vocabulary of words". For example, I have files in
    [touch_typing](file://touch_typing/) directory.

18. What strategy helps incrementally increase typing speed with specific words
    set?
    <br class="f">
    Incremental speed improving. "Aim for 5 WPM higher than your current speed
    and practice each set of words until reaching that target." So need
    constantly change lessons after you raised some point of speed.

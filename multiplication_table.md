# Multiplication table

> In [[mathematics]], a multiplication table (sometimes, less formally, a times
> table) is a mathematical table used to define a multiplication operation for
> an algebraic system.
>
> The decimal multiplication table was traditionally taught as an essential part
> of elementary [[arithmetic]] around the world, as it lays the foundation for
> arithmetic operations with base-ten numbers. Many educators believe it is
> necessary to memorize the table up to 9 × 9.
>
> The oldest known multiplication tables were used by the Babylonians about 4000
> years ago. However, they used a base of 60. The oldest known tables using a
> base of 10 are the Chinese decimal multiplication table on bamboo strips
> dating to about 305 BC, during China's Warring States period. "Table of
> Pythagoras" on Napier's bones.\

Basically multiplication table is set of multiply operations between **two
numbers**. And there no difference which number is first or second, because it's
following [[Commutative_Associative_and_Distributive_Laws]] property.

Half of the table is a mirror image of the other (diagonal line from top left to
bottom right), and you can memorize first part (small number x big number).

You can find that some operations are repeated in the multiplication table and
that operations are the patterns.

Better to learn mutliplication table in chunks:

- Columns: 1-5, Rows: 1-5
- Columns: 6-9, Rows: 1-5
- Columns: 1-5, Rows: 6-9. It's mostly same as previous, but learn/practice it too.
- Columns: 6-9, Rows: 6-9

## Patterns

Multiples of even numbers or even and odd numbers are always even numbers. 2x,
4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, 5x6, 9x8, etc.

2× is just doubling the number, 2x2=4, 2x3=6, 2x4=8, 5x2=10, 6x2=12, etc.

5× has a pattern: 5, 10, 15, 20, etc. It ends in either 0 or 5.

9× has a pattern, too: **9**, 1**8**, 2**7**, 3**6**, 4**5**, 5**4**, 6**3**,
7**2**, 8**1**, 9**0**. Now, notice how the "ones" place goes down: 9, 8, 7, 6,
...? And at the same time, the "tens" place goes up: 1, 2, 3,...?
Well, your hands can help! Example: to multiply 9 by 8: hold your 8th finger down, and you can count "7" and "2" ... the answer is 72.

10× is maybe the easiest of them all ... just put a zero after it.

11× is mostly easy: from 11×2 to 11×9 you just put the two digits together.
11×2=22, 11×3=33, ..., 11×9=99 and 11×11=121, 11×12=132

2x12 → double 2x12 → 24
3×12=36
4×12=48
5x12 → ends in 0, 60 (pattern above)
6×12=72
7×12=84
8×12=96
9×12=108
10x12 → add 0, 120

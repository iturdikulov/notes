# Version control

> In [[software_engineering]], version control (also known as revision control,

Version control system track changes over the files and allow recalling a
specific version of a file.

Modern developer tools can use multiple version control systems at the same
time. For example GIT and vim's built-in undo system (can be extended with
undotree plugin).

I also use cloud based VCS services like [[GitHub]] and [[GitLab]] to store my
source code, build artifacts and other files.

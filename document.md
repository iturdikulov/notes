# Document

> A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of
> thought, often the manifestation of non-fictional, as well as fictional,
> content. The word originates from the Latin Documentum, which denotes a
> "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doceō denotes "to teach". In the past, the
> word was usually used to denote written proof useful as evidence of a truth or
> fact. In the Computer Age, "document" usually denotes a primarily textual
> computer [[file]], including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and
> images. Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its transmission medium,
> e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents. "[[documentation]]"
> is distinct because it has more denotations than "document". Documents are
> also distinguished from "realia", which are three-dimensional objects that
> would otherwise satisfy the definition of "document" because they memorialize
> or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2-dimensional
> representations. While documents can have large varieties of customization,
> all documents can be shared freely and have the right to do so, creativity can
> be represented by documents, also. History, events, examples, opinions, etc.
> all can be expressed in documents.\

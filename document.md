# Document

> A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of
> thought, often the manifestation of non-fictional, as well as fictional,
> content. The word originates from the Latin Documentum, which denotes a
> "teaching" or "lesson": the verb doceō denotes "to teach". In the past, the
> word was usually used to denote written proof useful as evidence of a truth or
> fact. In the Computer Age, "document" usually denotes a primarily textual
> computer [[file|file]], including its structure and format, e.g. fonts,
> colors, and images. Contemporarily, "document" is not defined by its
> transmission medium, e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents.
> "[[documentation]]" is distinct because it has more denotations than
> "document". Documents are also distinguished from "realia", which are
> three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of
> "document" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are
> considered more as 2-dimensional representations. While documents can have
> large varieties of customization, all documents can be shared freely and have
> the right to do so, creativity can be represented by documents, also. History,
> events, examples, opinions, etc. all can be expressed in documents.\

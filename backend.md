# Backend

Main difference between frontend and backend?
&#10;
Fronted is data representation layer, backend is data access layer. And
this term includes not only software, but also hardware, physical
infrastructure, etc. Usually client is frontend and server is backend. Even
if some presentation work is done on server for example.

# Lua (programming language)

> Lua (/ˈluːə/ LOO-ə; from Portuguese: lua [ˈlu(w)ɐ] meaning moon) is a
> **lightweight**, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed
> primarily for ==**embedded== use** in applications. Lua is cross-platform,
> since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a
> relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.\

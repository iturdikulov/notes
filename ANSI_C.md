# ANSI C

> ANSI C, ISO C, and Standard C are successive standards for the
> [[C]] programming language published by the American
> National Standards Institute (ANSI) and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 14 of the
> International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International
> Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Historically, the names referred
> specifically to the original and best-supported version of the standard (known
> as C89 or C90). Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to
> the standards, as doing so helps portability between compilers.\

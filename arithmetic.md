# Arithmetic

> Arithmetic (from Ancient Greek ἀριθμός (arithmós) 'number', and τική (tikḗ)
> 'art, craft') is an elementary part of [[mathematics]] that consists of the
> study of the properties of the traditional operations on
> numbers—addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
> ==exponentiation, and extraction of roots==. In the 19th century, Italian
> mathematician Giuseppe Peano formalized arithmetic with his Peano axioms
> (disputed), which are highly important to the field of mathematical logic
> today.\

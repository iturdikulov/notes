# Documentation

> Documentation is any communicable material that is used to describe, explain
> or instruct regarding some attributes of an object, system or procedure, such
> as its parts, assembly, installation, maintenance and use. As a form of
> knowledge management and knowledge organization, documentation can be provided
> on paper, online, or on digital or analog media, such as audio tape or CDs.
> Examples are user guides, white papers, online help, and quick-reference
> guides. Paper or hard-copy documentation has become less common. Documentation
> is often distributed via websites, software products, and other online
> applications.\

I use [[dasht]] to search through offline dash documentation files.

For Unix commands and programs documentation I'm using `man` and `tldr`
(community-driven man pages client) programs.

Man usage: `man [OPTION...] [SECTION] PAGE...`

Tldr usage: `tldr [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]...`, one of useful option is `-L` to
change language.

One good source to inspiration, how documentation looks like, is
[git/Documentation](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/Documentation), in
terms of format, style and grammar.

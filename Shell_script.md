# Shell script

> Computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line
> interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be
> scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include
> file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. A script which sets
> up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup or
> logging, is called a wrapper.\

I personally [[My_shell_scripts|use]] a lot of shell scripts, mainly for simple
tasks or use some of them as wrappers for other programs.

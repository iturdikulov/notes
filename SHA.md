# Secure Hash Algorithms (SHA)

> The Secure Hash Algorithms are a family of [[cryptography]] hash functions
> published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a
> U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), including:
>
> - SHA-0: A retronym applied to the original version of the 160-bit hash
>   function published in 1993 under the name "SHA". It was withdrawn shortly
>   after publication due to an undisclosed "significant flaw" and replaced by
>   the slightly revised version SHA-1.
>
> - SHA-1: A 160-bit hash function which resembles the earlier MD5 algorithm.
>   This was designed by the National Security Agency (NSA) to be part of the
>   Digital Signature Algorithm. Cryptographic weaknesses were discovered in
>   SHA-1, and the standard was no longer approved for most cryptographic uses
>   after 2010.
>
> - SHA-2: A family of two similar hash functions, with different block sizes,
>   known as SHA-256 and SHA-512. They differ in the word size; SHA-256 uses
>   32-bit words where SHA-512 uses 64-bit words. There are also truncated
>   versions of each standard, known as SHA-224, SHA-384, SHA-512/224 and
>   SHA-512/256. These were also designed by the NSA.
>
> - SHA-3: A hash function formerly called Keccak, chosen in 2012 after a public
>   competition among non-NSA designers. It supports the same hash lengths as
>   SHA-2, and its internal structure differs significantly from the rest of the
>   SHA family.\

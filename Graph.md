# Graph (abstract data type)

> In [[Computer_science|computer science]], a graph is an abstract data type
> that is meant to implement the undirected graph and directed graph concepts
> from the field of graph theory within mathematics.
>
> A graph [[Data_structure|data structure]] consists of a finite (and possibly
> mutable) set of ==vertices (also called nodes or points)==, together with a
> set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of
> ordered pairs for a directed graph. These pairs are known as edges (also
> called links or lines), and for a directed graph are also known as edges but
> also sometimes arrows or arcs. The vertices may be part of the graph
> structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or
> references.
>
> A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such
> as a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.).\

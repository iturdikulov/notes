# Public-key cryptography

> Public-key [[cryptography]], or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of
> cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys. Each key pair consists
> of a public key and a corresponding private key. Key pairs are generated with
> cryptographic [[algorithm|algorithms]] based on [[mathematics|mathematical]]
> problems termed one-way functions.
> [[computer_security|Security]] of public-key cryptography depends on keeping
> the private key secret; the public key can be openly distributed without
> compromising security.\

Examples of protocols using asymmetric key algorithms include:

- S/MIME
- GPG, an implementation of OpenPGP, and an Internet Standard
- EMV, EMV Certificate Authority
- IPsec
- PGP
- ZRTP, a secure VoIP protocol
- Transport Layer Security standardized by IETF and its predecessor Secure
  Socket Layer
- SILC
- SSH
- Bitcoin
- Off-the-Record Messaging

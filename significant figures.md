# Significant figures

> Significant figures (also known as the significant digits, precision or
> resolution) of a number in positional notation are digits in the number that
> are reliable and necessary to indicate the quantity of something.
>
> If a number expressing the result of a measurement (e.g., length, pressure,
> volume, or mass) has more digits than the number of digits allowed by the
> measurement resolution, then only as many digits as allowed by the measurement
> resolution are reliable, and so only these can be significant figures.
>
> For example, if a length measurement gives 114.8 mm while the smallest
> interval between marks on the ruler used in the measurement is 1 mm, then the
> first three digits (1, 1, and 4, showing 114 mm) are certain and so they are
> significant figures. Digits which are uncertain but reliable are also
> considered significant figures. In this example, the last digit (8, which adds
> 0.8 mm) is also considered a significant figure even though there is
> uncertainty in it.

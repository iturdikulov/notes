# Software quality

> In the context of [[software_engineering]], software quality refers to two
> related but distinct notions:
>
> - Software's functional quality reflects how well it complies with or conforms
>   to a given design, based on functional requirements or specifications. That
>   attribute can also be described as the fitness for purpose of a piece of
>   software or how it compares to competitors in the marketplace as a
>   worthwhile product. It is the degree to which the correct software was
>   produced.
> - Software structural quality refers to how it meets non-functional
>   requirements that support the delivery of the functional requirements, such
>   as robustness or maintainability. It has a lot more to do with the degree to
>   which the software works as needed.
>
> Many aspects of structural quality can be evaluated only statically through
> the analysis of the software inner structure, its source code (see Software
> metrics), at the unit level, and at the system level (sometimes referred to as
> end-to-end testing), which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound
> principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by Object
> Management Group (OMG).\

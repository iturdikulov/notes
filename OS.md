# Operating system

> Group of computer programs, including device drivers, kernels, and other
> software that lets people interact with a computer. It manages computer
> hardware and software resources. It provides common services for computer
> programs.

> An OS can be small (like MenuetOS), or large (like Microsoft Windows,
> GNU/Linux). Different operating systems can be used for different purposes.
> Some are used for everyday things like on a personal computer
> (general-purpose). Others are mobile operating systems or are used for
> specialized work.\

# Color scheme

> In color theory, a color scheme is the choice of colors used in various
> artistic and design contexts. For example, the "Achromatic" use of a white
> background with black text is an example of a basic and commonly default color
> scheme in web design.
>
> Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an
> aesthetic feeling when used together will commonly accompany each other in color
> schemes. A basic color scheme will use two colors that look appealing together.
> More advanced color schemes involve several related colors in "Analogous"
> combination, for example, text with such colors as red, yellow, and orange
> arranged together on a black background in a magazine article. The addition of
> light blue creates an "Accented Analogous" color scheme.\

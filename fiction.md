# Fiction

> Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying
> individuals, events, or places that are imaginary or in ways that are
> imaginary. Fictional portrayals are thus inconsistent with history, fact, or
> plausibility. In a traditional narrow sense, "fiction" refers to **written**
> narratives in prose – often referring specifically to novels, novellas, and
> short stories. More broadly, however, fiction encompasses imaginary narratives
> expressed in any medium, including not just writings but also live theatrical
> performances, films, television programs, radio dramas, comics, role-playing
> games, and video games.\

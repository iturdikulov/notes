# Git Version Control System

Distributed revision control system, [[computer_program|computer program]],
designed to help people create other computer program together.

> Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to
> handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
> — <cite>[Git](https://git-scm.com/)</cite>

Git is useful to work with code without fear, you can experiment with code, use
multiple branches as features tree, if your decision was incorrect, you can
easily revert you changes. It's also useful for reviewing your changes and
collaborate.

Additional details can be found in @ProGitChacon2022 book. You
can also use built-in help: `man git`, `git help` or `git [command] –help`.

After installing git, you usually need to configure it, here minimal
configuration example, with my personal data:
```sh
git config --global user.name "First Lastname"
git config --global user.email "user@domain.tld"
```

Does Git store an entire snapshot of files per commit?
&#10;
Yes! Git stores an entire snapshot of files (not file changes) on a per-commit
level, but with some optimizations (data deduplication with pointers and
compression). So by default Git not good solution to work with large binary
files.

## Git tips

Here I store various flashcards, how to use git (sort of cheat sheet).

### General

Check the Git version:
&#10;
`git --version`

Show general help:
&#10;
`git --help`

Show help on a Git subcommand (like `clone`, `add`, `push`, `log`, etc.):
&#10;
`git help subcommand`

Execute a some Git subcommand:
&#10;
`git subcommand` <!--SR:!2023-06-07,3,252-->

Execute a Git subcommand on a custom repository root path:
&#10;
`git -C path/to/repo subcommand`

Execute a Git subcommand with a given configuration set:
&#10;
`git -c 'config.key=value' subcommand`

### Create repository

Create a new local repository, _project_name_ is optional. If no project name specified you'll create git repository in current directory. You can also use non-existing **nested** directories, git automatically create needed structure.
&#10;
`git init [project_name]`
<!--SR:!2024-06-21,153,312-->

Download from an existing repository. URL can be `http[s]...` or `git@...` (require specific private ssh key). If project path specified, git will clone into this directory.
&#10;
`git clone URL [project_path]`

Perform a shallow clone, to only get the latest commits, which helps to save data (good for limited data connections) when cloning large repos.
&#10;
`git clone --depth 1 <remote-url>`

Unshallow a clone.
&#10;
`git pull --unshallow`

### Git aliases

Alternative commands, like `git s` and `g` are special aliases, require specific git alias configuration.

Check your aliases:

`bat ~/.gitconfig`

### Observe a Repository

List new or modified files not yet committed (changes from last commit)
&#10;
`git status` or `git s`

Show the changes to files not yet staged (committed before).
Pretty useful to see what you changed before stage it.
&#10;
`git diff`

<!--SR:!2023-03-31,1,208-->

Show the changes to staged files (not committed)
&#10;
`git diff --cached`

Show all staged and unstaged file changes
&#10;
`git diff HEAD`

Show the changes between two commit ID's
&#10;
`git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2` Can be used with `HEAD` as well.

Show changes to files WITHOUT considering them a part of git. This can be used to diff files which are not part of a git repo!
&#10;
`git diff --no-index path/to/file/A path/to/file/B`

List the change dates and authors (who committed) for a file
&#10;
`git blame [file]`

Show the file changes for a commit ID and/or file
&#10;
`git show [commit]:[file]`

Show full change history
&#10;
`git log`
`gl` - custom alias

Get details of repository object (by commit hash)
&#10;
`git cat-file -p [commit hash]`

Git log, but limit to the last 10 commits and disable pager
&#10;
`git --no-pager log -n 10`

Find git commit that introduced a string in any branch
&#10;
`git log -S <string> --source --all`

View commits which would be pushed (commits in current local branch).
&#10;
`git log @{u}..`

View changes which are new on a feature branch.
&#10;

```bash
git log -p feature --not main
git diff main...feature
```

Show change history for file/directory including diffs
&#10;
`git log -p [file/directory]`

View differences of branches/stash with meld other tool?
&#10;
```bash
## To get list of toolname runt this:
## git difftool --tool-help

## Compare current branch with another branch
git difftool -d branchname -t toolname

## Compare current branch with stash
git difftool -d stash -t toolname
```
YOU CAN EDIT files in meld and save them!


### Branches

Working With Branches List all local branches
&#10;
`git branch`

List all branches, local and remote
&#10;
`git branch -a[v]`

Create a new branch called new **branch**
&#10;
`git branch new_branch`

Delete the branch called my **branch**
&#10;
`git branch -d my_branch`

Force Delete the branch "branch_name".
&#10;
`git branch -D [branch_name]`

Branches: To delete a remote branch "branch_name":
&#10;
`git push --delete origin [branch_name]`


Continue merge after resolving conflicts
&#10;
`git merge --continue`
And if you don't want to edit the message when continuing/resuming the merge:
`git merge --continue --no-edit`

Branches: To delete all branches on remote that are already merged:
&#10;
`git branch --merged | egrep -v "(^*|main|dev)" | xargs git branch -d`

Switch to a branch, my **branch**, and update working directory
&#10;
`git checkout my_branch`

Merge branch **foo** into branch **bar**
&#10;
`git checkout bar; git merge foo`

Create a bare branch; without any commits.
&#10;
`git checkout --orphan branch_name`

Checkout a new branch from a different starting point.
&#10;
`git checkout -b main upstream/main`

Reset local branch to upstream branch, then checkout it.
&#10;
`git checkout -B main upstream/main`

Undo parts of the last commit in a specific file.
&#10;
`git checkout -p HEAD^ -- /path/to/file`

Revert a commit, but keep the history of the event as a separate commit.
&#10;
`git revert <commit SHA>`

Perform an interactive rebase for the last (prior) 7 commits:
&#10;
`git rebase -i @~7`

Tag the current commit
&#10;
`git tag my_tag`
`git tag -a <tag> <commit> -m "<commit message>"`

Push a tag to remote:
&#10;
`git push origin <tagname>`

To delete a tag locally
&#10;
`git tag -d <tagname>`

Sign new tags:
&#10;
`git tag -s v1.5 -m 'my signed 1.5 tag'`

Delete a tag `<tagname>` on remote
&#10;
`git push --delete origin <tagname>`

Make an existing branch track a remote branch.
&#10;
`git branch -u upstream/foo`

### Changes into repository

Stages the file, ready for commit
&#10;
`git add [file]`
`git fza` - custom alias, interactive add

Stage all changed files or files which ready for commit
&#10;
- `git add .`
- `git add [--all|-A]` <!--SR:!2024-08-30,7,232-->

Stop tracking the file completely (leave it on disk) and remove from repo!
&#10;
`git rm --cached [file]`
Here exist alternative `"un-track"` and `"track"` commands, with this solution
file will stay in repo, but will not be tracked (updated) anymore, e.g., a
dev.properties file that you would need to change for your local environment but
you would never want to check in these changes:
`git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>`
If you want to start tracking changes again:
`git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>`

To list untracked files.
&#10;
`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard`

Remove untracked files.
&#10;
Use it with `-n` to see what will be removed.
`git clean -f -d``

Remove untracked and ignored files.
&#10;
Use it with `-n` to see what will be removed.
`git clean -f -d -x`

Commit all staged files (staged changes) to versioned history
&#10;
`git commit -m "Your commit message"`

==7== digits are the Git default for a short SHA, so that's fine for most
projects.

Edit previous commit message.
&#10;
`git commit --amend`

Change author of a commit.
&#10;
`git commit --amend --author="Author Name <email@address.com>"`

Commit in the past. Newer versions of Git allow `--date="2 days ago"` usage.
&#10;

```bash
## more recent versions of Git also support --date="2 days ago" directly
git commit --date="`date --date='2 day ago'`"
git commit --date="Jun 13 18:30:25 IST 2015"
```

Commit all your tracked files to versioned history
&#10;
`git commit -am "commit message`

Sign a commit
&#10;
`git commit -a -S -m 'Signed commit'`

Unstaged file, keeping the file changes
&#10;
`git reset [file]`

Undo last commit but keep the changes
&#10;
`git reset --soft HEAD~1`

Revert everything to the last commit.
So it removes staged and working directory changes.
&#10;
`git reset --hard` but be careful, you can lose your changes. Maybe need stash them first.

Undo last commit. If you want to nuke commit C to never see it again:
(F)
A-B-C
↑
main
&#10;
`git reset --hard HEAD~1`

Undo last commit. If you want to undo the commit, but keep your changes:
(F)
A-B-C
↑
main
&#10;
`git reset HEAD~1`

Go 2 commits back.
&#10;
`git reset --hard HEAD~2`

Checkout the current branch, and rebase from `<remote>`
&#10;
`git reset --hard <remote>/<branch>`

Apply only the changes made within a given commit. This is different to the `merge` command, as it would otherwise apply all commits from a branch.
`git cherry-pick [HASH]`

### Synchronize changes

Get the latest changes from origin (no merge)
&#10;
`git fetch`

Pull changes, while overwriting any local commits.
&#10;

```bash
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

Fetch the latest changes from origin and merge
&#10;
`git pull`

Fetch the latest changes from origin and rebase
&#10;
`git pull --rebase`
<!--SR:!2023-07-08,34,270-->

Pull down a remote branch, but rebase any locally differing commits onto the top of the incoming commits:
&#10;
`git pull <remote> <branch> --rebase`

Push local changes to the origin
&#10;
`git push`

To force a push, when you know what you're doing!
&#10;
`git push -f`

Push to the tracked main branch.
&#10;
`git push origin main`

<!--SR:!2023-04-02,3,248-->

Push to a specified repository.
&#10;
`git push git@github.com:[USER_NAME]/[REPO_NAME].git`

### Git stash

Stash changes locally. This will keep the changes in a separate changelist, - called 'stash', and the working directory is cleaned. You can apply changes from the stash at any time.
&#10;
`git stash`

Stash changes with a message.
&#10;
git stash push accepts the message with option -m and accepts a list of files to stash as arguments.
`git stash push -m <message>`

List all the stashed changes.
&#10;
`git stash list`

Apply the most recent change and remove the stash from the stash list.
&#10;
`git stash pop`

Apply stash from the stash list, but does not remove the stash from the list.
&#10;
`git stash apply stash@{6}`

### Git remote

Remove all stale branches; ones that have been deleted on remote. So if you have a lot of useless branches, delete them on GitHub and then run this.
&#10;
`git remote prune origin`

Prune all remotes at once.
&#10;
`git remote prune $(git remote | tr '\n' ' ')`

### Other

List files changed in a given commit.
&#10;
`git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r [HASH]`

Revisions can also be identified with `:/text`. So, this will show the first
commit that has the string "cool" in its message body.
&#10;
`git show :/cool`

List files changed in a given commit; user-facing approach.
&#10;
`git show --pretty="" --name-only bd61ad98`

See everything you have done, across branches, in a glance, then go to the place right before you broke everything.
&#10;
`git reflog`
`git reset HEAD@{hash}`

To revert first/initial commit on a branch:
Running git reset --hard HEAD~1 will give error:
fatal: ambiguous argument `'HEAD~1'`: unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
&#10;
`git update-ref -d HEAD`

To import commits from another repo:
&#10;
`git --git-dir=../some_other_repo/.git format-patch -k -1 --stdout <commit SHA> | git am -3 -k`

Update all submodules.
&#10;
`git submodule update --init --recursive`

Check any signatures it finds and list them in its output:
`git log --pretty="format:%h %G? %aN %s"`

Sync a fork with the master repo.

```bash
git remote add upstream git@github.com:name/repo.git # <-- Set a new repo.
git remote -v # <-- Confirm new remote repo.
git fetch upstream # <-- Get branches.
git branch -va # <-- List local - remote branches.
git checkout master # <-- Checkout local master branch.
git checkout -b new_branch # <-- Create and checkout a new branch.
git merge upstream/master # <-- Merge remote into local repo.
git show 83fb499 # <-- Show what a commit did.
git show 83fb499:path/to/file.ext # <-- Show the file as it was in 83fb499.
git diff branch_1 branch_2 # <-- Check difference between branches.
git log # <-- Show all of the commits.
git status # <-- Show the changes from the last commit.
```

Set your identity.

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

The GPG key used for signing your commits
`git config --global user.signingkey 0A46826A`

Set signing of commits globally
`git config --global commit.gpgsign true`

Set your editor.
`git config --global core.editor nvim`

Enable color support for commands like `git diff`.
`git config --global color.ui true`

Remove file from git after adding it into `.gitignore`

```bash
## Check, you committed all required changes before
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Fix untracked files"
```

Change the date of an existing commit.

```bash
git filter-branch --env-filter \
    'if [ $GIT_COMMIT = 119f9ecf58069b265ab22f1f97d2b648faf932e0 ]
     then
         export GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="Fri Jan 2 21:38:53 2009 -0800"
         export GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="Sat May 19 01:01:01 2007 -0700"
     fi'
```

Display the commit history of a set of files.
`git log --pretty=email --patch-with-stat --reverse --full-index -- Admin\*.py > Sripts.patch`

Move your most recent commit from one branch, to stage it on [BRANCH].

```bash
git reset HEAD~ --soft
git stash
git checkout [BRANCH]
git stash pop
git add .
```

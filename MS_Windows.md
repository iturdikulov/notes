## Windows LTSC Edition

Windows from Enterprise Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC), long-term support
variant of Windows Enterprise released every 2 to 3 years. Each release is
supported with security updates for either 5 or 10 years after its release, and
intentionally receive no feature updates. **Some features**, including the
Microsoft Store and bundled apps, are **not included** in this edition. However,
Windows Store can be installed using a command prompt. This edition was first
released as Windows 10 Enterprise LTSB (Long-Term Servicing Branch). There are
currently 4 releases of LTSC: one in 2015 (version 1507), one in 2016 (version
1607), one in 2018 (labeled as 2019, version 1809), and one in 2021 (version
21H2). In 2024 planned next release.

# Binary number

> A binary [[number]] is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or
> binary numeral system, a method of mathematical expression which uses only two
> symbols: typically `"0"` (zero) and `"1"` (one).
>
> The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each
> digit is referred to as a bit, or binary digit. Because of its straightforward
> implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary
> system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices, as a
> preferred system of use, over various other human techniques of communication,
> because of the simplicity of the language and the noise immunity in physical
> implementation.
>
> Negative numbers are commonly represented in binary using two's complement.\
> — <cite>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number)</cite>

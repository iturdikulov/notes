# Rendering (computer graphics)

> Rendering or image synthesis is the process of generating a photorealistic or
> non-photorealistic image from a 2D or 3D model by means of a
> [[Computer_program|computer program]]. The resulting image is referred to as
> the render. Multiple models can be defined in a scene file containing objects
> in a strictly defined language or data structure. The scene file contains
> geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information describing the
> virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a
> rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster
> graphics image file. The term "rendering" is analogous to the concept of an
> artist's impression of a scene. The term "rendering" is also used to describe
> the process of calculating effects in a video editing program to produce the
> final video output.
>
> Rendering is one of the major sub-topics of
> [[3D_computer_graphics|3D computer graphics]], and in practice it is always
> connected to the others. It is the last major step in the graphics pipeline,
> giving models and animation their final appearance. With the increasing
> sophistication of computer graphics since the 1970s, it has become a more
> distinct subject.\

# Photography

> Photography is the [[art]], application, and practice of creating durable
> images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor,
> or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic
> film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g.,
> photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film
> and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.
>
> Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects
> into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a [[camera]
> during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an
> electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored
> in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with
> photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically
> "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive, depending on
> the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A
> negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a
> positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger
> or by contact printing.\

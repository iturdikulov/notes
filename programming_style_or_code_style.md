# Programming style (code style)

> Set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a
> [[computer_program]]. It is often claimed that following a particular
> programming style will help [[programmer|programmers]] read and understand
> [[source_code]] conforming to the style, and help to avoid introducing errors.
>
> A classic work on the subject was
> [[Kernighan_and_Plauger-The_Elements_of_Programming_Style|The Elements of
> Programming Style]] , written in the 1970s, and illustrated with examples from
> the FORTRAN and PL/I languages prevalent at the time.\

My first experience with code style was while I learned basics of web
development and I mainly checked [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).

Coding conventions are a set of guidelines for a specific programming language
that recommend programming ==style, practices, and methods== for each aspect of
a program written in that language. Coding conventions are not enforced by
compilers (but may be enforced by static analysis tools).

The elements of programming style are next what I will read.
TODO: check in the future, did I read it?

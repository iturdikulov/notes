# Database

> In [[computing]], a database is an organized collection of data (also known
> as a data store) stored and accessed electronically through the use of a
> database management system. Small databases can be stored on a file system,
> while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The
> design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations,
> including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query
> languages, security and privacy of sensitive data, and distributed computing
> issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.\

Databases which I use or want to try:

- [[PostgreSQL]]
- [[MySQL]]
- [[SQLite]]
- [[Redis]]

A relational database (RDB) is a database based on the relational model of
data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.[2] A database management system used to
maintain relational databases is a relational database management system
(RDBMS). Many relational database systems are equipped with the option of using
SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and updating the database.

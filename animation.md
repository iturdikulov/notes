# Animation

> Animation is the method that encompasses myriad filmmaking techniques, by
> which still images are manipulated to create moving images. In traditional
> animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets
> (cels) to be photographed and exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized
> as an artistic medium, specifically within the entertainment industry. Many
> animations are computer animations made with computer-generated imagery (CGI).
> Stop motion animation, in particular claymation, has continued to exist
> alongside these other forms.\

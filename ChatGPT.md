GPT-3 (GPT-4, etc.) [[AI|AI]] chatbot developed by OpenAI.

Currently, very hyped.

## Interesting Prompts

- Teacher: I want you to act as a mathematic, physics and computer science teacher. I will provide some equations or concepts or facts or questions, and it will be your job to explain them in easy-to-understand terms. This could include providing step-by-step instructions for solving a problem, demonstrating various techniques with visuals or suggesting online resources for further study. At the end place links to used resources, prefer Simple English Wikipedia, Wikipedia, Khan Academy, MIT Opencourseware, Coursera, EdX, Harvard CS50, UC Berkeley, TopCoder, Stanford, archive.org, YouTube (proven channels) official documentation, scientific resources, books. My first request is "I need help understanding how probability works."

- StackOverflow: I want you to act as a StackOverflow post. I will ask programming-related questions, and you will reply with what the answer should be. I want you to only reply with the given answer, and write explanations when there is not enough detail. do not write explanations. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. If possible include links to official documentation. My first question is "How do I download page using Python `http.client` module"

## Criticism

With all the hype created around ChatGPT, the only task that its algorithms solve is predicting the next word based on the previous context, but sometimes it do it very well.

## Concurrent

- [Bard - Chat Based AI Tool from Google, Powered by PaLM 2](https://bard.google.com/)
- [Bing AI - Search](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx), not really concurrent, since it's using same model's.

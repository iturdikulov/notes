# JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It
> is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and
> generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language
> Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is
> completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to
> programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,
> JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal
> data-interchange language.\

JSON is built on two structures:

- A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an
  object, record, struct, dictionary, [[hash_table]], keyed list, or associative
  array.

- An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an
  [[array]], vector, list, or sequence.

# Neomutt

> NeoMutt is a text-based application which interacts with users through
> different menus which are mostly line-/entry-based or page-based. A line-based
> menu is the so-called “index” menu (listing all messages of the currently
> opened folder) or the “alias” menu (allowing you to select recipients from a
> list). Examples for page-based menus are the “pager”(showing one message at a
> time) or the “help” menu listing all available key bindings.
>
> The user interface consists of a context sensitive help line at the top, the
> menu's contents followed by a context sensitive status line and finally the
> command line. The command line is used to display informational and error
> messages as well as for prompts and for entering interactive commands.
>
> NeoMutt is configured through variables which, if the user wants to
> permanently use a non-default value, are written to configuration files.
> NeoMutt supports a rich config file syntax to make even complex configuration
> files readable and commentable.
>
> Because NeoMutt allows for customizing almost all key bindings, there are
> so-called “functions” which can be executed manually (using the command line)
> or in macros. Macros allow the user to bind a sequence of commands to a single
> key or a short key sequence instead of repeating a sequence of actions over
> and over.

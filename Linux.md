> There is a lot of [[computer_software|software]] for Linux and—like Linux itself—a lot of the software for Linux is free software. This is one reason why many people like to use Linux.\

One of Unix/Linux important idea is everything is ==a file==, with some exceptions (semaphores, processes and threads).

# Open source

> Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible
> modification and redistribution. Products include permission to use the source
> code, design documents, or content of the product. The open-source model is a
> decentralized software development model that encourages open collaboration. A
> main principle of open-source software development is peer production, with
> products such as source code, blueprints, and documentation freely available
> to the public. The open-source movement in software began as a response to the
> limitations of proprietary code. The model is used for projects such as in
> open-source appropriate technology, and open-source drug discovery.\

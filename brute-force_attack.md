# Brute-force attack
&#10;<br>
> In [[cryptography]], a brute-force attack consists of an attacker
> submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing
> correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and
> passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can
> attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a
> key derivation function. This is known as an exhaustive key search.\

# Berserk

> Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a Japanese
> [[manga]] series written and illustrated by Kentaro Miura. Set in a
> medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world, the story centers on the
> characters of Guts, a lone swordsman, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary
> band called the "Band of the Hawk". The series follows Guts' journey seeking
> revenge on Griffith, who betrayed him and sacrificed his comrades to become a
> powerful demonic being. Miura premiered a prototype of Berserk in 1988. The
> series began the following year in the Hakusensha's now-defunct magazine
> Monthly Animal House, which was replaced in 1992 by the semimonthly magazine
> Young Animal, where Berserk has continued its publication. Following Miura's
> death in May 2021, the final chapter that he wrote and illustrated was
> published posthumously in September of the same year; the series resumed in
> June 2022, under supervision of Miura's fellow manga artist and childhood
> friend Kouji Mori and Miura's group of assistants and apprentices from Studio
> Gaga.\

Personally I like this series, some moments too "dark" for me, but atmosphere is
exciting. I mostly watched anime and skimmed series.

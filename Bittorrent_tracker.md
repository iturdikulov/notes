# BitTorrent tracker

> A BitTorrent tracker is a special type of server that assists in the
> communication between peers using the BitTorrent protocol.
>
> In peer-to-peer file sharing, a software client on an end-user PC requests a
> file, and portions of the requested file residing on peer machines are sent to
> the client, and then reassembled into a full copy of the requested file. The
> "tracker" server keeps track of where file copies reside on peer machines,
> which ones are available at time of the client request, and helps coordinate
> efficient transmission and reassembly of the copied file. Clients that have
> already begun downloading a file communicate with the tracker periodically to
> negotiate faster file transfer with new peers, and provide
> [[Computer_network|network]] performance statistics; however, after the
> initial peer-to-peer file download is started, peer-to-peer communication can
> continue without the connection to a tracker.
>
> Tracker can be public or private.\

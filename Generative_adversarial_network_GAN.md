# Generative adversarial network (GAN)

> A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning
> framework and a prominent framework for approaching generative
> [[Artificial_intelligence|AI]]. The concept was initially developed by Ian
> Goodfellow and his colleagues in June
> 2014. In a GAN, two neural networks contest with each other in the form of a
> zero-sum game, where one agent's gain is another agent's loss.
>
> Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same
> statistics as the training set. For example, a GAN trained on
> [[Photography|photographs]] can generate new photographs that look at least
> superficially authentic to human observers, having many realistic
> characteristics. Though originally proposed as a form of generative model for
> unsupervised learning, GANs have also proved useful for semi-supervised
> learning, fully supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
>
> The core idea of a GAN is based on the "indirect" training through the
> discriminator, another neural network that can tell how "realistic" the input
> seems, which itself is also being updated dynamically. This means that the
> generator is not trained to minimize the distance to a specific image, but
> rather to fool the discriminator. This enables the model to learn in an
> unsupervised manner.
>
> GANs are similar to mimicry in evolutionary biology, with an evolutionary arms
> race between both networks.\

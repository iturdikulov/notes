# Sorting algorithm

> Puts elements of a list into an ==order==. The most frequently used orders are
> numerical order and lexicographical order, and either ascending or descending.
> Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the [[computational_complexity]]
> of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input
> data to be in sorted lists. Sorting is also often useful for canonicalizing
> data and for producing human-readable output.\

Sorting algorithms solve the following problem:
Given an array of unsorted vales (list), how can we sort them so that they end
up in ==order==? <!--SR:!2024-09-09,6,238-->

List of sorting algorithms (which I know):

- [[bubble_sort_algorithm]]
- [[selection_sort]]
- [[insertion_sort]]
- [[quicksort]]

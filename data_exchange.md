# Data exchange

> Data exchange is the process of taking [[data_structure|data structured]]
> under a source schema and transforming it into a target schema, so that the
> target data is an accurate representation of the source data. Data exchange
> allows data to be shared between different
> [[computer_program|computer programs]].
>
> It is similar to the related concept of data integration except that data is
> actually restructured (with possible loss of content) in data exchange. There
> may be no way to transform an instance given all of the constraints.
> Conversely, there may be numerous ways to transform the instance (possibly
> infinitely many), in which case a "best" choice of solutions has to be
> identified and justified.\

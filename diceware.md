# Diceware

> Diceware is a method for creating passphrases, passwords, and other
> [[cryptography|cryptographic]] variables using ordinary dice as a hardware
> random number generator. For each word in the passphrase, five rolls of a
> six-sided die are required. The numbers from 1 to 6 that come up in the rolls
> are assembled as a five-digit number, e.g. 43146. That number is then used to
> look up a word in a cryptographic word list. In the original Diceware list
> 43146 corresponds to munch. By generating several words in sequence, a lengthy
> passphrase can thus be constructed randomly.\

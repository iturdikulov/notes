# Sleep

> Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity in which
> consciousness is altered and sensory activity is inhibited to a certain
> extent. During sleep, there is a decrease in muscle activity, and interactions
> with the surrounding environment. While sleep differs from wakefulness in
> terms of the ability to react to stimuli, it still involves active brain
> patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.\

> Sleep is a state of resting, which happens in animals, including humans.
> During deep sleep, most of the muscles that animals can otherwise control are
> not active, but regain the energy for the next time they wake up. Animals
> during sleep are usually in an unconscious, relaxed state. Like most animals,
> healthy sleep in humans takes place at night. Asleep describes the condition
> where animals are in the process of sleeping. During this time, they will not
> react as quickly (if at all) as they would if they were awake. They can,
> however, wake up from sleep more easily than from hibernation or coma. All
> mammals, birds, many reptiles, amphibians and fish have a sleep cycle. In
> humans, other mammals, and most other animals that were studied, regular sleep
> is essential for survival.\

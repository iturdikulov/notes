# Computer-aided design (CAD, CADD)

> Use of [[computer|computers]] (or workstations) to aid in the creation,
> modification, analysis, or optimization of a design. This
> [[computer_program|software]] is used to increase the productivity of the
> designer, improve the quality of design, improve communications through
> documentation, and to create a database for manufacturing. Designs made
> through CAD software are helpful in protecting products and inventions when
> used in patent applications. CAD output is often in the form of electronic
> files for print, machining, or other manufacturing operations. The terms
> computer-aided drafting (CAD) and computer aided design and drafting (CADD)
> are also used.
>
> CAD may be used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional (2D) space; or
> curves, surfaces, and solids in three-dimensional (3D) space.
>
> CAD has been a major driving force for research in computational geometry,
> [[computer_graphics]] (both hardware and software), and discrete differential
> geometry.\

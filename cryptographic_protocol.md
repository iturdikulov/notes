# Cryptographic protocol

> A cryptographic protocol is an abstract or concrete protocol that performs a
> [[computer_security]]-related function and applies
> [[cryptography|cryptographic]] methods, often as sequences of cryptographic
> primitives. A protocol describes how the [[algorithm|algorithms]] should be
> used and includes details about data structures and representations, at which
> point it can be used to implement multiple, interoperable versions of a
> program.
>
> Cryptographic protocols are widely used for secure application-level data
> transport. A cryptographic protocol usually incorporates at least some of
> these aspects:
>
> - Key agreement or establishment
> - Entity authentication
> - Symmetric encryption and message authentication material construction
> - Secured application-level data transport
> - Non-repudiation methods
> - Secret sharing methods
> - Secure multi-party computation\

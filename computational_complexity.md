# Computational complexity

> In [[computer_science]], the computational complexity or simply complexity of
> an algorithm is the amount of resources required to run it. Particular focus
> is given to [[Time_complexity|computation time]](generally measured by the
> number of needed elementary operations) and memory storage requirements. The
> complexity of a problem is the complexity of the best algorithms that allow
> solving the problem.\

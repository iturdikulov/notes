# 1. Whetting Your Appetite

In this section described when Python can be usable. For example scripting,
creating simple program with GUI, automate some daily work.

Also described strong points of Python, such as rapid development (write /
compile / test / re-compile cycle), interactivity, extensibility, splitting
into modules, simple integration, automation, batteries-included.

Python is ==[[Interpreter|interpreted]]== language, no compilation and linking
is necessary (but possible). <!--SR:!2024-12-09,23,250-->

Python can be used as "glue language", to connect components together.

Main differences between [[C]], [[Java]], [[Go]] etc.:
&#10;<br>
- the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single
statement;
- statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending
brackets;
- no variable or argument declarations are necessary. <!--SR:!2024-11-16,1,229-->

Primary Python paradigm is?
&#10;<br>
Python is primarily [[OOP|object-oriented]] [[programming_language]],
but also supports imperative, functional, and procedural paradigms. <!--SR:!2024-11-19,5,230-->

Python typing is?
&#10;<br>
Python is dynamically typed. <!--SR:!2024-11-12,8,250-->

Python compiled or interpreted language?
&#10;<br>
Interpreted language. <!--SR:!2024-11-11,7,250-->

Do python have garbage collection feature?
&#10;<br>
Yes, memory management is done with automatic garbage collection. <!--SR:!2024-12-06,20,250-->

Is Python code readable (at least for most people)?
&#10;<br>
Yes, known for being clear and concise with readable syntax, since used spaced
indentation, simplified expression of complex things, etc. <!--SR:!2024-12-04,20,250-->

Is Python programs fast?
&#10;<br>
Generally considered slower than compiled languages, but optimized for rapid
development and readability, in recent years there significant performance
improvements. <!--SR:!2024-11-23,7,250-->

Is Python high-level or low-level language?
&#10;<br>
Python is [[high-level_programming_language]]. <!--SR:!2024-12-17,32,270-->

Can I create some product usually faster with Python?
&#10;<br>
Usually yes, python features including rapid development and connecting various
components of programming system. <!--SR:!2024-12-02,18,250-->

# Elementary particles

> In particle [[physics]], an elementary particle or fundamental particle is a
> subatomic particle that is not composed of other particles. Particles
> currently thought to be elementary include electrons, the fundamental fermions
> (quarks, leptons, antiquarks, and antileptons, which generally are matter
> particles and antimatter particles), as well as the fundamental bosons (gauge
> bosons and the Higgs boson), which generally are force particles that mediate
> interactions among fermions. A particle containing two or more elementary
> particles is a composite particle.\

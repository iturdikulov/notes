# Linked data structure

> In [[Computer_science|computer science]], a linked data structure is a
> [[Data_structure|data structure]] which consists of a set of data records
> ([[Node|nodes]]) linked together and organized by references (links or
> pointers). The link between data can also be called a connector.
>
> In linked data structures, the links are usually treated as special data types
> that can only be dereferenced or compared for equality. Linked data structures
> are thus contrasted with arrays and other data structures that require
> performing arithmetic operations on pointers. This distinction holds even when
> the nodes are actually implemented as elements of a single array, and the
> references are actually array indices: as long as no arithmetic is done on
> those indices, the data structure is essentially a linked one.\

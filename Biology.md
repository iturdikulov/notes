# Biology

> Biology is the scientific study of life. It is a natural [[Science|science]]
> with a broad scope but has several unifying themes that tie it together as a
> single, coherent field. For instance, all organisms are made up of cells that
> process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to
> future generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity
> and diversity of life. Energy processing is also important to life as it
> allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce. Finally, all organisms are able
> to regulate their own internal environments.\
